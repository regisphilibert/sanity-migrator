Beset by aphasia and grief, Ralph Waldo Emerson is scarcely recognizable as America\u2019s foremost essayist and orator. To the dismay of his wife, he frequently entertains the specters of his fellow transcendentalists, including Whitman, Thoreau, John Muir, and Margaret Fuller, and frets about the future of humankind and the natural world. Does the present displace the past? Do ideas always precede actions? What responsibility does each of us bear for the downtrodden, the preservation of liberty, and the Earth itself? These metaphysical concerns become concrete when Emerson meets a Black soldier accused of killing a white man who abused him. The soldier\u2019s presence demands a response from Emerson, an action outside the parlors of philosophy and beyond the realm where language and logic hold sway.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Ice Harp<\/em>, the tenth stand-alone book in <a href=\"http:\/\/blpress.org\/books-by-keyword\/american-novels-series\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The American Novels series<\/a>, is a poignant portrayal of a

<em>Canci\u00f3n<\/em>, Eduardo Halfon\u2019s eponymous wanderer is invited to a Lebanese writers\u2019 conference in Japan, where he reflects on his Jewish grandfather\u2019s multifaceted identity. To understand more about the cold, fateful day in January 1967 when his grandfather was abducted by Guatemalan guerillas, Halfon searches his childhood memories. Soon, chance encounters around the world lead to more clues about his grandfather\u2019s captors, including a butcher nicknamed \u201cCanci\u00f3n\u201d (or song). As a brutal and complex history emerges against the backdrop of the Guatemalan Civil War, Halfon finds echoes in the stories of a woman he meets in Japan whose grandfather survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.<\/p>\n<p>Through exquisite prose and intricate storytelling, Halfon exposes the atrocities of war and the effect that silence and extreme violence have on family and identity.<\/p>\n<p>In consultation with the author, <em>Canci\u00f3n <\/em>was translated from the Spanish by <a href=\"http:\/\/spanport.emory.edu\/home\/people\/faculty\/dillman-lisa.html\"

in the Dead House"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>After the Union Army\u2019s defeat at Fredericksburg in 1862, Walt Whitman and Louisa May Alcott converge on Washington to nurse the sick, wounded, and dying. Whitman was a man of many contradictions: egocentric yet compassionate, impatient with religiosity yet moved by the spiritual in all humankind, bigoted yet soon to become known as the great poet of democracy. Alcott was an intense, intellectual, independent woman, an abolitionist and suffragist, who was compelled by financial circumstance to publish saccharine magazine stories yet would go on to write the enduring and beloved <em>Little Women<\/em>. As Lock captures the musicality of their unique voices and their encounters with luminaries ranging from Lincoln to battlefield photographer Mathew Brady to reformer Dorothea Dix, he deftly renders the war\u2019s impact on their personal and artistic development.<\/p>\n<p>Inspired by Whitman\u2019s poem \u201cThe Wound-Dresser\u201d and Alcott\u2019s <em>Hospital Sketches<\/em>, the ninth

Her sources range from the trial of Joan of Arc to the essays of Virginia Woolf and Elaine Scarry to Hugh Laurie\u2019s portrayal of Gregory House on\u00a0<em>House M.D<\/em>. As she engages with science, philosophy, visual art, rock lyrics, and field notes from her own medical adventures (both mainstream and alternative), she finds a way to express the often-indescribable experience of living with pain.

After committing an act of petty theft at an antiques market, he finds himself trapped inside a wardrobe and delivered to the seemingly idyllic home of a husband, wife, and their internet-addicted teenage daughter. There, he sneaks from the shadows to serve as an invisible butler, becoming deeply and disastrously\u00a0involved with his unknowing host family. Every thread of the plot is ingeniously tied together, creating a potent admixture of parable, love story, and thriller. Mill\u00e1s masterfully reveals the everyday as innately surreal as he renders the unbelievable tangible and the trivial fantastical, and full of dark humor.<\/p>\n<p><em>From the Shadows<\/em> is

Unable to prevent the girl\u2019s tragic decline while doctors, nurses, and a local priest keep watch, she documents the curious family dynamic, the trial that convicted Sarah\u2019s parents, and an

Trip to Orvieto"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>After a visit to the cathedral at Orvieto in Italy, Sigmund Freud deemed Luca Signorelli\u2019s frescoes the greatest artwork he\u2019d ever encountered; yet, a year later, he couldn\u2019t recall the artist\u2019s name. When the name came back to him, the images he had so admired vanished from his mind\u2019s eye. This is known as the \u201cSignorelli parapraxis\u201d in the annals of Freudian psychoanalysis and is a famous example from Freud\u2019s own life of his principle of repressed memory. What was at the bottom of this? There have been many theories on the subject, but Nicholas Fox Weber is the first to study the actual Signorelli frescoes for clues.<\/p>\n<p>What Weber finds in these extraordinary Renaissance paintings provides unexpected insight into this famously confounding incident in Freud\u2019s biography. As he sounds the depths of Freud\u2019s feelings surrounding his masculinity and Jewish identity, Weber is drawn back into his own past, including his memories of an adolescent obsession with a much older woman.<\/p>\n<p><em>Freud\u2019s Trip to Orvieto<\/em> is an intellectual mystery with a very personal, intimate dimension. Through rich illustrations, Weber evokes art\u2019s singular capacity to provoke, destabilize, and enchant us, as it did Freud, and awaken our deepest memories, fears, and desires.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Foreword Reviews <\/em>\u201cInspiring Gift Books\u201d selection<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nicholas Fox Weber\u2019s

Kosinski was a great enigma of post-World War II literature. When he exploded onto the American literary scene in 1965 with his best-selling novel <em>The Painted Bird<\/em>, he was revered as a Holocaust survivor and refugee from the world hidden behind the Soviet Iron Curtain. He won major literary awards, befriended actor Peter Sellers (who appeared in the screen adaptation of his novel <em>Being There<\/em>) and was a guest on talk shows and at the Oscars. But soon the facade began to crack, and behind the public persona emerged a ruthless social climber, sexual libertine, and pathological liar who may have plagiarized his greatest works.<\/p>\n<p>Jerome Charyn lends his unmistakable style to this most American story of personal disintegration, told through the voices of multiple narrators\u2014a homicidal actor, a dominatrix, and Joseph Stalin\u2019s daughter\u2014who each provide insights into the shifting facets of Kosinski\u2019s personality. The story unfolds like a Russian nesting doll, eventually revealing the lost child beneath layers of trauma, while touching on the nature of authenticity, the atrocities of WWII, the allure of sadomasochism, and the fickleness of celebrity.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>New York Times<\/em> \u201cEditors\u2019 Choice\u201d selection<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Evening Standard

been taken from him, but his injury has left him with neglect syndrome, a loss of spatial awareness that has rendered him unfit to practice and unable to recognize the extent of his illness. Despite support from his formerly estranged brother and two grown daughters, his paranoia builds, alienating those closest to him. His only solace is found in the parallels he draws between himself and gifted Soviet-era architect Konstantin Melnikov, who survived Stalin\u2019s disfavor by retreating into obscurity. As Martin retraces Melnikov\u2019s life and his own fateful decisions, he becomes increasingly unsettled, until the discovery of the harrowing truth about the night of his accident hurtles him toward

To this, we add: nothing is funnier than unhappiness with a heavy dose of amorality, as we learn from Robert Lopez\u2019s unforgettable <em>Good People<\/em>. In these twenty stories, a motley cast of obsessive, self-deluded outsiders narrate their darker moments, which include kidnapping, voyeurism, and psychic masochism. As their struggles give way to the black humor of life\u2019s unreason, the bleak merges with the oddly poetic, in a style as lean and resolute as Carver or Hemingway.<\/p>\n<p>Treading the fine line between confession and self-justification, the absurd violence of threatened masculinity, and the perverse joy of neurosis, Lopez\u2019s stories reveal the compulsive suffering at the precarious core

condition that typically afflicted healthy children just emerging from the flu or other minor illnesses. It began with vomiting, followed by confusion, coma, and in 50 percent of all cases, death. Survivors were often left with permanent liver or brain damage. Desperate, terrorized parents and doctors pursued dramatic, often ineffectual treatments. For over fifteen years, many inconclusive theories were posited as to its causes. The Centers for Disease Control dispatched its Epidemic Intelligence Service to investigate, culminating in a study that suggested a link to aspirin. Congress held hearings at which parents, researchers, and pharmaceutical executives testified. The result was a warning to parents and doctors to avoid pediatric use of aspirin, leading to the widespread substitution of alternative fever and pain reducers. But before a true cause was definitively established, Reye\u2019s syndrome simply vanished.<\/p>\n<p>A harrowing medical mystery, <i>Keep Out of Reach of Children<\/i> is the first and only book to chart the history of Reye\u2019s syndrome and reveal the confluence of scientific and social forces that determined the public health policy response, for better or for ill.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mark A.

The galaxies, previously believed to float serenely in the void, are in fact hurtling apart at an incredible speed: the universe is expanding. This stunning discovery was the culmination of a decades-long arc of scientific and technical advancement. In its shadow lies an untold, yet equally fascinating, backstory whose cast of characters illuminates the gritty, hard-won nature of scientific progress.<\/p>\n<p>The path to a broader mode of cosmic observation was blazed by a cadre of nineteenth-century amateur astronomers and inventors, galvanized by the advent of photography, spectral analysis, and innovative technology to create the entirely new field of astrophysics. From William Bond, who turned his home into a functional observatory, to John and Henry Draper, a father and son team who were trailblazers of astrophotography and spectroscopy, to geniuses of invention such as L\u00e9on Foucault, and George Hale, who founded the Mount Wilson Observatory, Hirshfeld reveals the incredible stories\u2014and the ambitious dreamers\u2014behind the birth of

the currents of the mighty Mississippi from one adventure to the next. Launched into existence by Mark Twain, they have now been transported by Norman Lock through three vital, violent, and transformative centuries of American history. As time unfurls on the river\u2019s banks, they witness decisive battles of the Civil War, the betrayal of Reconstruction\u2019s promises to the freed slaves, the crushing of Native American nations, and the electrification of a continent. While Jim enters real time when he disembarks the raft in the Jim Crow South, Huck finally comes of age when he\u2019s washed up on shore during Hurricane Katrina. An old man in 2077, Huck takes stock of his life and narrates his own story, revealing our nation\u2019s past, present, and future as Mark Twain could never have dreamed it.<\/p>\n<p>The first

Forever.\u00a0 And\u2014nevermore.<\/i>\r\n\r\n<i>\u00a0<\/i>\r\n\r\nThe model never stops moving, quickly or slowly, according to the rhythm the teacher beats out on the drum.\u00a0 Snowflakes descend on the glass roof of the studio forming tiny drifts, melting and sliding down from the warmth from inside.\u00a0 The blue glow of the evening outside, the fireplace crackles.\u00a0 Vienna is languishing from a shortage of wood, but here, because of the naked models, they must have heat.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the main reason evening drawing classes are so popular this year, the students come to get warm, say the professors.\u00a0 They envy the success of the new teacher, Meinlich, who was accepted from the Academy of Applied Arts in September to replace the late drawing professor Janecek.\r\n\r\nA wave of enthusiasm swept through the students during the first few weeks of the school year, primarily directed at this young man wearing wire-rimmed spectacles.\r\n\r\nAlmost none of the professors can make sense of the enchantment that has possessed their charges.\u00a0 The students work with much greater diligence and overflow with ideas, but they\u2019re also unruly.\u00a0 They want to do everything their own way and they\u2019re brimming with bewildering ideas, which they could not have come up with themselves.\u00a0 They insist that each lesson begin with a ridiculous ten-minute breathing exercise which is supposed to help initiate the flow of the subconscious and free the creative powers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA naked man on a wooden platform in the middle of the room halts at Meinlich\u2019s signal, drapes a blanket over his shoulders, and sits down to rest.\u00a0 Berta drops her charcoal and waves her hand, which is already starting to hurt.\u00a0 She\u2019s here for the first time after a long illness.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t know how to draw a moving body or even what the drum and rhythmic breathing of the students are supposed to mean.\u00a0 She also doesn\u2019t understand the religious silence of the students that sets in at the beginning of class when the teacher enters and starts speaking in a soft, indistinctive voice.\u00a0 She understands nothing, but she doesn\u2019t care, she views events from outside, armored in her sorrow.\u00a0 She was afraid to go back to school where she won\u2019t find Maja.\u00a0 And now she\u2019s here, surrounded by familiar and unfamiliar faces; she\u2019s indifferent to them.\u00a0 She sits and holds her scratchings on her lap.\r\n\r\nMeinlich walks among the students and examines their work.\u00a0 Here and there he injects a word or adds a line with a piece of charcoal, illuminating the drawing from another angle.\u00a0 When he halts by her side, Berta blushes:\u00a0 I\u2019m here for the first time.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t think, says Meinlich.\u00a0 Follow the curve of your breath, and with your hand the movement of the model.\r\n\r\nFrom a distance he looks like a boy, but up close he doesn\u2019t appear so young; he\u2019s definitely over thirty.\u00a0 When he smiles, wrinkles gather beneath his round spectacles.\u00a0 Something in the timbre of his voice or in the way he speaks produces a feeling of tranquility in the listener, as if he were being absorbed by a warm, clear center.\u00a0 Later his enemies will rename him the Snake Charmer and mock him, but Berta, just like her classmates, will succumb to him.\r\n\r\nThe snow is still falling.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hour most of the students pack up their things and, after respectfully saying goodbye to Meinlich, depart in groups of twos and threes.\u00a0 Berta packs up her drawing supplies and sketchbook in her leather satchel but is in no hurry to leave.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t look forward to going back out into the chilly darkness. \u00a0She\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s remained behind.\u00a0 A circle of five boys and girls has formed around the teacher, and they\u2019re trying to talk him into something.\u00a0 Apparently they\u2019ve acquired his consent and are merrily moving toward the door.\u00a0 When they pass Berta, who is still sitting lost in thought, one of them stops beside her and says:\u00a0 We\u2019re going on a walk with Robert. \u00a0Want to come?\u00a0 It\u2019s a little cold, but Robert doesn\u2019t go to caf\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nShe recognizes that voice.\r\n\r\nA darkened terrace; inside, bright chandeliers and the faces of her friends.\u00a0 Red wine, in connection with something unpleasant.\u00a0 And then he shot his brains out!\r\n\r\nDid you hear me?\r\n\r\nShe looks up:\u00a0 Do you know they\u2019re dead?\u00a0 Maja and Rudi?\r\n\r\nJust pronouncing their names makes her eyes well with tears.\r\n\r\nCome with us, he says and picks up her bag.\u00a0 Just come.\r\n\r\nThey exit the school and turn left toward the city park.\u00a0 The snowstorm has just let up.\u00a0 They are the first people to leave their tracks on the clean surface.\u00a0 Someone suggests they make a snow statue.\u00a0 They work together in silence.\u00a0 Some sort of headless, bulky, recumbent woman emerges.\u00a0 Meinlich is happy as a child, like one of them.\u00a0 His presence arouses a sense of happiness in them.\u00a0 Disproportionate to external circumstances, as Berta later realized\u2026\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p align=\"center\">*<\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u2026They became inseparable.\u00a0 Together they floundered through the anxieties of winter and together they greet the spring.\u00a0 They have ventured outside the city to the river.\u00a0 The young leaves are budding on the trees, the forest on the opposite bank is a translucent green, and the sun is slowly dissolving the morning fog.\u00a0 The ground is still cold, but there\u2019s a feeling of downy softness.\u00a0 And relief.\r\n\r\nSuffering is unnecessary, thinks Max.\u00a0 Pain belongs to the old, and the old to the past.\u00a0 We are building new cities full of light and gardens, where people will learn to be happy and free.\u00a0 The colors of our paintings will introduce love into people\u2019s hearts.\u00a0 In the new society, without coercion, without jealousy, we will share our art and our life.\r\n\r\nBerta bends down for a nicely formed branch.\u00a0 She turns it over and thrusts it into the soft earth.\u00a0 It\u2019s a bird.\r\n\r\nA gryphon? asks Max.\r\n\r\nBerta nods.\r\n\r\nThey reach the southern slope which the sun has already managed to dry.\r\n\r\nBerta turns around several times, closes her eyes, and plops down on the grass.\r\n\r\nI would like to go to Italy, she says.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s go, nods Max.\u00a0 He feels the grass with his hand and only then sits down.\u00a0 Today for the first time he is wearing his light trousers.\r\n\r\nBerta laughs out loud.\r\n\r\nWhat are you laughing at?\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re so careful.\r\n\r\nThe sun spreads in all directions upon the surface of the water, lightly stirred by the wind, and suffuses their eyes with radiance.\r\n\r\nBerta spreads her arms wide and cries out like a hawk.\r\n\r\nThey breakfast on sandwiches Berta has brought along from home, wash them down with bottled water, and then take a walk along the river.\u00a0 The sun is beginning to burn.\u00a0 Max makes a little hat out of his handkerchief and covers his head.\u00a0 His sensitive, white skin is beginning to redden, and his freckles are breaking out.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Aaron\u2019s

Glad to escape the unseasonal heat of an October afternoon, she is eager to make the acquaintance of the Pagets, rumored to be an intellectually rigorous, if peculiar, family. At the insistence of a friend who had recommended them, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson have accepted an invitation to tea at the Paget residence before returning to London. They have just come from Venice, where Mary was introduced to Henry Layard, an archaeologist whose discoveries at Nineveh had so fascinated her at the British Museum, as well as to Ernest Renan, the heretical French philosopher, theologian, and Orientalist. Mary has just published her first volume of poetry, <i>A Handful of Honeysuckle<\/i>, and with her innate\u00a0confidence further bolstered by adoring parents, she has assumed a tenuous place on the lower rung of London\u2019s literary circles.\r\n\r\nIn response to Mr. Robinson\u2019s firm knock, a female servant draws open the massive black door to the Paget residence. Mary follows her parents into an imposing north-lit room with ornate embossed ceilings, a series of high, narrow windows swagged with crimson satin brocade, and a purplish marble mosaic floor. Yellow roses bloom from various antique painted pots, and a quantity of dark, carved eighteenth-century furniture is placed, with no apparent plan, about the room\u2014including a priest\u2019s confessional box, uncurtained and piled with firewood. In the midst of this shadowy, storybook atmosphere sits a slight young woman with golden brown wavy hair, her inquisitive gray eyes strangely magnified by a fantastic pair of huge eighteenth-century green goggles. Violet Paget stands, stretches out a hand, the slim white fingers emerging like petals from the cutting immobility of her black dress\u2019s severe cuff, and greets each of her guests by turn. (For her part, Violet is struck by the young creature rippling toward her, holding a dainty lace-edged parasol. The otherworldly luminosity, the charismatic dark eyes limpid with sympathy\u2014exactly how she has always pictured the baron\u2019s clever daughter in Scheffel\u2019s <i>Der Trompeter von S\u00e4kkingen<\/i>!)\r\n\r\nThe first hour passes in glittering arpeggios of polite conversation accompanied by cups of black tea and milk, followed in the second hour by biscotti and glasses of <i>vin santo<\/i>. From his horizontal pulpit, Eugene tells in a delicate, oratorical whisper, more breath than sound, the latest tattle\u00a0on his little sister, Violet. Just yesterday, he whispers, she had crouched in the garden shrubbery beneath an open window while their mother, sitting at her piano near that same window, tinkled out the crystalline opening notes of an eighteenth-century song, \u201cPallido il sole,\u201d Hasse\u2019s piece, famously sung by the castrato Farinelli to mad King Philip of Spain\u2014music that had arrived by post that morning. Unwrapping the paper parcel from Bologna, Violet declared that her reputation hung on this one composition, and had handed the score to mother before hurtling downstairs into the garden to hear each note as it floated through the window, released from ivory and black keys by the imperious, agile pressure of Matilda\u2019s fingers. Moments later, Violet crept upstairs to further listen through the cool plaster wall of an adjoining room, against which first her left, then her right ear pressed flat. Hasse\u2019s song proved superb, thus preserving the theories she had set forth in <i>Studies of the Eighteenth Century in Italy<\/i>, published earlier that year by W. Satchell and Co., London.\r\n\r\nMary Robinson listens to Eugene whisper on about his sister, thinking what a paradox she seems, this small, strange-looking Violet Paget. All outward timidity and childlike vulnerability, yet bristling, picketed, by a ferocious, encyclopedic, old mind.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson acquiesce to Mary\u2019s and Violet\u2019s pleading and leave for London without their daughter. They have agreed to let Mary stay on with the Paget family, though, as they later discuss between themselves on the train, the household is nothing if not bizarre, what with the brother broadcasting from his rolling bed like some hermaphroditic Roman pedant, only the large, slipshod mouth moving, and the tiny mother, embalmed in the resin of eighteenth-century fashion and speech, straight down to her oyster-colored, bobbing ringlets and strange Quaker usage of \u201cthee\u201d and \u201cthou!\u201d\u2014followed by the Byronesque father (what was his name?), mute as stone but for an occasional non sequitur regarding the superior hunting and fishing to be had in a place called Thun, and finally, young Violet, her opinions and recitations erupting lavalike from a brain of seeming universal capacity and in such a stammering, pinched, unfortunate voice that her physical composition, poor child\u2014that great jutting man jaw, porcine eyes and thin suet-colored hair\u2014is only further accentuated. Still, they saw no harm in Mary\u2019s forming an otherwise brilliant acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe Robinsons\u2019 afternoon visit had been a mere foretaste of their daughter\u2019s monthlong stay with the Pagets, a sojourn Mary will detail in a barrage of daily letters to her parents. Imagine, she writes, a household existing only to debate opinions of art, music, poetry and philosophy, a family (aside from the father, who is largely absent) breathing only, morning till night, for the disciplined pleasures of the intellect. Mary describes late-morning excursions in a landau specially kitted out for Eugene, a smoothed plank laid across the sides so that he can lie prone upon it, how she and Violet perch on either side, vestal creatures, shading Eugene\u2019s broad, pallid face with black silk parasols while Beppe, with his team of bays, drives them out of Florence, high into the pastoral hills and winding streams of San Gervasio along a dirt road following Lungo l\u2019Affrico, the very stream referenced in Boccaccio\u2019s <i>Decameron<\/i>! Sometimes she and Violet climb down from the cart to gather armloads of forget-me-nots, reeds, boughs of spindle wood, small bunches of grape hyacinth and wreathe Eugene\u2019s straw hat with loose garlands of wildflowers. In one letter, Mary attempts to convey the atmosphere of the Paget salons, the parade of stellar visitors\u2014the Italians (Carlo Placci, Enrico Nencioni), the Russians (Peter Boutourline), the French (Anatole France!), the Americans and the British (Henry James, Aldous Huxley), the Germans (Karl Hillebrand, Adolf von Hildebrand)\u2014really, she can\u2019t be expected to remember them all\u2014glittering constellations of sculptors, critics, composers, poets, translators, musicians, diplomats, novelists, and always, there comes that last, inescapable salon hour when Matilda Paget, a demiregal doll creature, faded ringlets bouncing, attacks her piano\u2019s keyboard, everyone in the room made to listen to the explosive or subsiding end, of Beethoven, Schubert, or Scarlatti. In one letter to her parents, Mary quotes Eugene, how he had opined during that day\u2019s luncheon, with a sour expulsion of air from his lungs, that \u201cinvalidism, like infection, breeds sublime poetry.\u201d The horizon, he labored on, was his singular vantage point. Fastened to his board by day, wheeled about by servants, sideways and aslant, at night, in dreams, he is upright, walking freely. . . . \u201cI speak from the perspective of the dead, though I am as yet unburied. There are twelve types of horizon I have\u00a0discovered and given name to. . . .\u201d This, Mary writes, is one manner in which Eugene might open a conversation with whoever is near\u2014in this case, herself. His poetry, what she has read of it, is sluggish, black-veined stuff, tragic as drowning. The poems, she confides to her parents, seem overinfluenced by Poe and Baudelaire; several are fatally tinctured with self-pity.\r\n\r\nShe writes nothing of Eugene\u2019s sister, because she has fallen in love with her. And because in Violet, who has begun to use the pseudonym Vernon Lee (\u201cLet us admit that any male writer shall always receive more attention than a female\u201d), Mary has discovered a friend whose knowledge of music, literature, and art surpasses her own. Has ever such a gorgeous mind issued forth from a mere woman, Mary marvels, writing in her private journal by the thin, sallow light of a bedside candle. Being with Violet is intoxicating, how Mary imagines it must have been to be in the presence of the French Symbolist poet Verlaine. Vernon\u2014she really must stop calling her Violet\u2014expounds easily on any manner of subjects in any of four subtly conjugated languages, French, German, English, and the Tuscan dialect of Dante. The breadth and depth of her friend\u2019s intelligence, enfolded, engraved deep within its young brain, can never be fully sounded; it settles around Mary like a cloak or climate, like some infinite and liberating perspective. And though Mary sometimes hears her friend\u2019s verbal wit descend into cruel impatience, she still admires her. If Vernon cannot abide hypocrisy, must attack and undo it with pitiless words, is there not rough honor in that? Aware her own ideas and opinions are diluted with counterfeit kindness, Mary is inspired, watching Vernon brandish her way through dense thickets of social nicety and dead form.\r\n\r\nTheir month together passes quickly, and on the morning she must leave, Mary extracts a promise from Vernon\u00a0that she will visit London the following Spring and stay with Mary in her parents\u2019 home on Gower Street, a mere twenty-minute walk from the marvels and antiquities of the British Museum.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 -

When you put down this book, push back your chair, and stand up, you will be standing on 52 of them: Your two feet.\r\n\r\nHuman beings are bipeds. We naturally and consistently stand and move on two feet rather than four or eight or any other multiple of two.\r\n\r\nWe share our bipedalism only with birds and two species of mammals, the macropods\u2014\u201cbig footed\u201d kangaroos and wallabies\u2014and the very small-footed kangaroo mice, jumping rodents native to the Southwestern United States. As avian anatomists know, birds hop on what looks like two feet but is actually comparable their toes; the \u201cheel\u201d of a bird\u2019s foot is part of a toe; the piece just above that corresponds to the sole of your foot. Theoretically, all the rest of us can walk, run, jump, and jog, although the last\u2014a compromise between walking and running\u2014is pretty much the province of humans.\r\n\r\nEach of us owes our two-footed stance to the prehistoric sea creatures who developed fins strong enough to enable them to crawl up the banks of the local watering hole and become land animals; then to Eduibamus, a reptile with long back legs and short front ones, thought to be the first known biped; virtually all dinosaurs, some crocodiles, and every bird on earth that stood up on two legs and started to move by putting one foot in front of the other; and finally to a confluence of geography, climate, and biological selection which produced the foot on which we stand today.\r\n\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, no slouch himself at anatomical mechanics, described this foot as \u201ca masterpiece of engineering and a work of art.\u201d His famous drawing, \u201cThe Vitruvian Man,\u201d lays out the standards for the ideal human male figure from head to, yes, toes attached to a foot which, ideally, should measure one-sixth the height of the body.\r\nIt is possible that Leonardo saw something of himself in the ideal man. In Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1550), Giorgio Vasari described da Vinci as \u201can artist of outstanding physical beauty\u201d and a man endowed by heaven with beauty, grace and talent.\u201d Dutch portraitist Siegfried Woldhek has suggested that Leonardo may have used his own features as the model for the Vitruvian man. Certainly he was not shy about his physical appearance; even as the older man portrayed in the statue that stand outside the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, he preferred to show his legs, wearing clothes usually reserved for younger men.\r\n\r\nOver the centuries since Vitruvius wrote his rules and da Vinci made them immortal, the marvelous human foot has walked its way straight into the English language:\r\n\r\nSometimes, we mistakenly set off on the wrong foot when, to be successful, we should put our best foot forward and start off on the right foot, a trio of locutions that track back to the ancient relationship between left (sinistre) being wrong and right (dextra) being, well, right. And if you have noticed that many of the people in Egyptian paintings seem to have their feet on wrong, you\u2019re right. In Egyptian art, only the royals had both a right foot and a left foot; lesser mortals were drawn with two left feet.\r\n\r\nToday, timid people have cold feet, the imperfect have feet of clay. The decisive will put their foot down, the bold jump in with both feet and, regardless of the fall, always land on their feet. Those in a hurry hot foot it along. And if any of these fail to give us a proper answer to a proper question, we will hold their feet to the fire.\r\n\r\nAt The End, most of us leave this world feet first so that our spirits will not be tempted to return\u2014unless the feet in question are attached to the body of a priest who is carried from the church head first, looking back at his congregation to which he expects to return.\r\n\r\nAt least in spirit.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/

He grew quiet, calm, composed, mild. He became pleasing in his demeanor so that his outward form seemed, almost, to copy an altered nature. Almost, for the deformity\u2014the most notable aspect of his appearance (a misshapenness that had been thought the visible evidence of an inward corruption)\u2014persisted. It could not be otherwise, for Jekyll\u2019s chemistry had produced the outlines of Hyde\u2019s very form. The skull was too large, as if the fontanelles, which had closed in infancy, had been reopened by a gigantic subterranean strain. The hands, too, were overlarge, pelted and sinewed like an animal\u2019s. The backbone had been violently recast into the likeness of a heavy swag of iron chain, such as decorates a courthouse entrance. And yet, it was possible now for his jailers to look at Hyde without shuddering, because his soul no longer seemed to them repugnant. Even the asylum\u2019s fastidious chaplain, who had fled from Hyde\u2019s insistent blasphemies, would stop to give him the comforts of his Savior, for which Hyde would bless him. Hyde\u2019s reclamation soon came to the attention of the Superintendent and then to the Home Office, which recommended clemency toward the prisoner. No longer considered dangerous or insane, Hyde was given a larger, more pleasant cell on one of the asylum\u2019s upper floors, with a view of sky and English countryside. He was allowed to take daily exercise on the asylum grounds and given other privileges reserved for the reformed. He would die at Broadmoor: no provision existed for his release. But he might live out his life there in relative ease. The public had forgotten him entirely, in favor of the hated Boer, whose iniquities belittled Hyde\u2019s in the popular press and imagination.\r\n\r\nThis was the Hyde to whom Frederick Drayton was introduced in the winter of 1900, in Hyde\u2019s bright, if spare, cell, with an aspidistra struggling on the brick sill and a curtain at the window to keep out the morning light. He was not \u201cthe child of Hell\u201d Stevenson had promised and that he, Drayton, had been expecting. The man who rose politely to acknowledge his visitor was reserved, remarkably kempt, and almost gentle in his manner. Hyde might have been a caretaker or a gardener attached to some estate.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Love Among the Particles<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Norman Lock\u2019s Love Among the Particles is a dark and marvelous journey from the Industrial Age, through Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age, into the Digital Age and beyond.

The pressure in my chest warned of impending danger. At six o'clock there was a knock at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPolice! Open up!\u201d Two men came in: a Polish policeman and a streetcar driver. Pola was sleeping with Elzunia. The two men surveyed the room. The streetcar driver had made sure to close the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jews!\u201d the policeman shouted in a menacing voice.\r\n\r\nI was in such shock that I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was speechless with fear.\r\n\r\n\u201cGet up! Get dressed! We\u2019re taking you to headquarters. We have proof you're Jewish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Leave us alone.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve done or not done is no concern of ours. You\u2019re Jewish, and that's enough for the Gestapo.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, they were ransacking the room in search of valuables. They found nothing of interest.\r\n\r\nMy wife begged for mercy, and five-year-old Elzunia fell to her knees before a holy image lit by a small red lamp and was praying aloud. Kaczynski, who had taken her to church a few times, had taught her some Catholic prayers, and she firmly believed she had been baptized. Now she knew that she and her parents were in grave danger. With tear-filled eyes uplifted to the image of the Virgin Mary, and hands folded, she was pleading for salvation. The policeman looked at the child and ordered a halt to the search. The child\u2019s fervent prayers had moved him, and he let Pola speak.\r\n\r\nIt turned out they were informers and wanted a ransom of 10,000 zlotys. Pola bargained them down to 4,000. We handed over all the money we had in the apartment, and gave our word of honor that we would pay them the rest within the week.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will sell a few things and give you what I get for them,\u201d I assured them.\r\n\r\nThe policeman looked tenderly at Elzunia.\r\n\r\n\u201cI swear on that sacred picture and on the Holy Cross, and on the head of my son, who is the same age as your daughter, whose prayer went straight to my heart, that you may continue to live here in peace. No one shall find out about you.\u201d\r\n\r\nI took the informers to a nearby bar. When they were suitably drunk, they told me who had given them our address; Zygmunt, the forger. He had probably not done it intentionally; because he was an alcoholic, cheap booze had probably loosened his tongue.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home, we discussed our situation.\r\n\r\nWe had no other hideout, and we had no choice but to stay there and take the informers at their word. That was an unforgivable mistake. We should never have stayed in a compromised hideout. But Gniewkowski could no longer help us; after the tragedy of the Ziembinskis he was suffering from anxiety. We should have gone back to Bronia\u2019s, but we didn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nWe knew how vulnerable we were, though, so we resolved to place Elzunia in safety. If we were to die, then at least the child would live. But first I had to come up with the rest of the ransom.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 -

All the while, Northern Ireland moves to the brink of civil war. As Catholic Republicans and Protestant Loyalists clash during the \u201cTroubles,\u201d the lines between private anguish and public outrage disintegrate in this exceptional tale about a family\u2014and a country\u2014seeking freedom from ghosts of the past.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Irish Book Awards Shortlist<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><em>Library Journal<\/em> Best Indie Fiction of the Year<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><i>Chatelaine <\/i>magazine Book Club selection<i><\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><em>Concord Monitor\/Concord Insider<\/em> Book of the Week<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Publishers Weekly<\/i> Best Summer Book Staff Pick<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>Brooklyn Book Festival Most Impressive Debut Novelist<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Late Night Library<\/i> Battle of the Books Final Four<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>City Lights Bookstore Staff Pick<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Politics &amp; Prose Bookstore Staff Pick<\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><em>Ghost Moth<\/em>, by Irish actress and debut novelist Mich\u00e8le Forbes, is an exceptional tale about a family whose buried secrets come to light during a time known as \u201cThe Troubles,\u201d when Catholic Republicans and Protestant Loyalists clashed in the streets of Belfast.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1572,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":true,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","enabled":false}}},"product_cat":[363,1242],"product_tag":[383,1221,384],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"acf":{"sm_book_page_count":"252","book_subtitle":"","related_author":[798],"sm_reading_group_copy":"","sm_reading_group_discussion":"","sm_book_excerpt":"Upstairs Katherine walks quickly into her bedroom and closes the door behind her. Laundry has been left on the end of the bed. George\u2019s shirts are ironed and hanging on the handle of the wardrobe door. Katherine opens the wardrobe, kneels down and, reaching into the very back of it, pulls out a small box wrapped in cloth. She unravels the cloth and opens the box. Inside the box is something covered in waxy paper. She opens the paper and reveals a small porcelain statuette of an old man, a clay pipe in one hand and a needle and thread in the other. The smooth, bald head of the statuette had broken off when she had let it slip from her hands the day George was helping her move out of her mother\u2019s flat. She holds both pieces in her hand and looks at them.\r\n\r\nAs she lifts the paper in which the statuette had been wrapped she feels the jolt it gives. She opens it out. She invites it in. It is a music sheet; before she sang at every rehearsal she would take out her little hand-held mirror and her lipstick from her handbag and ease orange-red across her lips. Then, folding her music sheet in half\u2014this piece of paper in front of her\u2014she would push it against her mouth to take the excess. Scattered all around the page, like a swarm of orange-red insects, are her rosebud lipstick kisses. A sheet music full of kisses, little signals of orange-red love, each one a promise that she would nurture the spirit of her dreams until they came true. She sees the handwritten musical notation and the lyrics from Carmen\u2014\u201cSi tu ne m\u2019aimes pas, si ti ne m'aimes pas, je t\u2019aime!\u201d\u2014and at the bottom of the sheet a handwritten translation\u2014\u201cIf you don\u2019t love me, if you don\u2019t love me and I\u2019m mad about you!\u201d With this her mind flashes with an image grim and disturbing. No, don't go there. No, not that. She blots it out.\r\n\r\nThe bedroom door opens and George steps a little into the room, but he stops in his tracks when he sees what Katherine is holding in her hand. He knows immediately what it is.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Ghost

Simone would not get to sleep while she felt him tense and hostile despite himself. It was as though they had turned into thistles for each other. His apprehension of her was the only out- ward sign of the onset of death. Simone knew the exact spot beneath his left shoulder blade where the pain had first started up. There was no seeing it and no reaching it, however much she pressed as he first asked her to, embarrassed to find himself worried\u2014really worried\u2014and bizarrely offended. The word cancer had been a relief to him, since he had at least not been wrong in insisting about the pain. On the X-rays, the milky shadow smudged out the top of his left lung and spread over the pleura and ribs. Claude was irritable and taciturn when he came home from his hospital appointments. He had put up with it for too long and now there was no hope; his one aim was to hurtle to the end as fast as possible. He gave them no option and refused to discuss it. His intolerance of pity and questions was nasty. Simone no longer knew how to love him properly, or, indeed, how to love him at all, and there was no one around to whom she could admit that she had started to resent him for it. The memory of Ga\u00ebl\u2019s affection and the way he had kissed her with his whole face planted firmly against her cheek continued to make her tingle. Soundlessly, she began to cry about her physical loneliness, imagining that it would be forever.\r\n\r\nYou didn\u2019t shut the living room blinds. The rebuke broke the silence abruptly, like a dry cough. Simone countered it with slow, regular breathing, as though she were asleep. Tears rolled into her mouth and over her neck. She dared not suggest moving into a separate room, and he would never admit that the presence of his partner in bed with him was unbearable for his body, for his anxiety about death, and maybe, too, for his guilt at abandoning her. Simone wondered how long you could share a painful space guarded against you with such hostility.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 -

I was drinking a Moza at the bar. I prefer dark beer. It makes me think about old-fashioned taverns and sword fights. I lit a cigarette and she asked me in English, sitting on a stool to my right, if I would give her one. I guessed by her accent that she was Israeli. Bevakash\u00e1, I said to her, which means you\u2019re welcome in Hebrew, and I held the box of matches out to her. She got friendly right away. She told me something else in Hebrew that I didn\u2019t understand and I clarified for her that I really only remembered three or four words and a random prayer or two and maybe how to count to ten. Fifteen, if I really tried. I live in the capital, I told her in Spanish to show her that I wasn\u2019t an American, and she confessed to me that she was confused because she hadn\u2019t imagined that there were Jewish Guatemalans. I\u2019m not Jewish anymore, I smiled at her, I retired. How are you not, that\u2019s not possible, she yelled in the way that Israelis tend to yell. She turned towards me. She was wearing a thin white cotton Indian style blouse, worn jeans and yellow espadrilles. Her hair was dark brown and she had emerald blue eyes, if emerald blue even exists. She explained to me that she had recently finished her military service, that she was traveling around Central America with her friend and that they had decided to stay in Antigua for a few weeks to take Spanish language classes and make a little money. With her, she pointed to show me. Yael. Her friend, a serious and pale girl with exquisite shoulders, had served me a beer. I greeted her while they spoke in Hebrew, laughing, and I thought I heard them mention the number seven at one point, but I\u2019m not sure why. A German couple came in and her friend went to serve them. She grabbed my hand firmly, told me it was such a pleasure to meet me, that she was named Tamara, and then took another cigarette without asking me.\r\n\r\nI ordered another beer and Yael brought us two Mozas and a plate of chips. She stayed there standing in front of us. I asked Tamara her last name. I remember that it was Russian. Halfon is Lebanese, I said, but my mother\u2019s last name, Tenenbaum, is Polish, from Lodz, and both girls shrieked. It turned out that Yael\u2019s last name was also Tenenbaum, and while she verified it on my driver\u2019s license, I started to think about the remote possibility that we were from the same family, and I imagined an entire novel about two Polish siblings that thought that their entire family had been exterminated, but all of a sudden find each other, after sixty years apart, thanks to the grandchildren, a Guatemalan writer and an Israeli hippy, who had met by chance in a Scottish bar that wasn\u2019t even Scottish in Antigua Guatemala. Yael got a liter of cheap beer and filled three glasses. They gave me my license back and we toasted to us, to them, to the Poles. We stayed silent, listening to an old Bob Marley song and contemplating the immense smallness of the planet.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin

He tugged the slack shoulder to free it from the muddy patch in which it lay, and turned the corpse to face the sun. Like the hundreds of other troops inspecting the bodies strewn among the marshy tufts and sandy stretches of this desolate edge of the island, this soldier knew precisely for whom he was searching. Nevertheless, he must have been startled by the fleshy, mustachioed face that instantly stood out from the hundreds of other dead scattered among the mangroves, a face that stared back at him through dull, half-closed eyes, lips barely apart as if to utter a final command.\r\n\r\nA bullet had pierced the forehead and the cranial cap was blasted away, but the otherwise intact figure of the corpulent founder and leader of the Tamil Tigers lay where he had fallen some hours ago. His brown face had been drained of blood, leaving a pallid waxwork that seemed to illuminate the oddness of this iconic figure lying in a mud patch, as though it were a discarded picture torn from a page in Life magazine. Despite the dirt, his uniform was neat and undamaged, as if he had emerged from a hidden bunker at the last possible moment to meet his death headlong. A holstered pistol was clamped to a belt around his thick midriff, along with six unused pouches of ammunition, and clipped to his chest was an identity card with his name, picture and the serial number \u2018001\u2019. Among the few possessions found in his small kit bag was a bottle of grape-scented hand lotion purchased in Singapore \u2013 an incongruous detail that the newspapers in Colombo would later seize on to discredit the fallen leader\u2019s reputation for rigid asceticism.\r\n\r\nThe Sinhalese soldier who chanced upon the corpse of Velupillai Prabakharan at the edge of the Nandikadal lagoon on the north-east coast of Sri Lanka had not even been born when the dead man began his career of violent insurgency. In 1975, when just twenty-one years old, and already with a reputed taste for rebellion and guns, Prabakharan assassinated the Tamil mayor of Jaffna with a single shot to the head as he prepared for prayer at a Hindu temple. Although Sri Lanka\u2019s tourist brochures boast of the island\u2019s balmy beaches, its soaring white Buddhist shrines, the warmth of its people and its sweeping mountain tea estates, this brutal temple killing was in fact a more fitting symbol of the young state, marred by ethnic, religious, caste and class warfare.\r\n\r\nAll through this young soldier\u2019s boyhood, the name of Prabakharan loomed large in the speeches of politicians, and was decried in interviews with the policemen and generals who tried to hunt him and his Tamil Tiger guerrillas down. The few photos that existed of his square-jawed face, either scowling or bearing a shy smile that mocked the cut of his fatigues, had for thirty years featured almost daily in Sri Lankan newspapers and on television screens, above articles detailing the mounting atrocities committed by Tamil Tiger forces. The stocky figure personified the claim of Tamil nationalists to a third of Sri Lanka\u2019s territory and, for the Sinhalese community, a fear of \u2018the other\u2019 that lived among them.\r\n\r\nPrabakharan\u2019s shy manner and soft voice belied the orders he regularly issued to his guerrilla cells: to bomb buses full of women and children, assassinate heads of state, sink or seize ships, murder child monks and kill prisoners. The mantra of the global Tamil Tiger propaganda network was that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), as they called themselves, represented the right to Sri Lankan Tamil self-determination based around an independent state that would be known as Tamil Eelam. The fanaticism and commitment of the Tiger fighters recalled to observers the struggles of other post-colonial liberation movements such as the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, whose repugnant acts in the name of freedom seemed nevertheless to embody an elemental human instinct for justice and identity. Tamil Tiger fighters strung vials of cyanide around their necks in case of capture, and as a symbol of their readiness to die for \u2018the Movement\u2019.\r\n\r\nOn the sandy spit that morning, the soldier radioed his position to his unit commander. He in turn raised the officer commanding Sri Lanka\u2019s 58th battlefield division \u2013 the division that had fought the Tamil Tigers until their final destruction at the edge of the lagoon. The brigadier was driven in a jeep from his forward command headquarters through an abandoned tent city that sprawled across the narrow pockmarked spit, a wasteland of torn plastic sheeting, bodies and burned-out vehicles. Since February, the tents had sheltered around 330,000 men, women and children besieged by the SLA, which pounded the area with heavy weapons in an effort to crush the Tamil Tiger guerrillas operating within the siege zone.\r\n\r\nOver many weeks, as the Tiger strength waned, army assaults pierced the guerrillas\u2019 defences, and tens of thousands of civilians escaped in small batches or great waves. They struggled across the shallow lagoon that divided the government and Tiger forces, carrying their weak, wounded, elderly and young. Some were too exhausted or frightened to tend to those who were struck by bullets as they escaped, and ignored those who sank below the surface of the lagoon. The tent city, and anyone injured or left huddling in the trenches, was consumed as government troops moved in for the final kill. It was a conflagration of grenades and gunfire. In their flight, the refugees had left thousands of their dead in unmarked graves or simply lying in the open, discarded in the frantic rush to escape.\r\n\r\nThe battlefield was now silent \u2013 the groans of the wounded and dying expired. The brigadier walked the final few hundred metres across waterlogged grasslands, surrounded by his bodyguards, who shielded him against any surviving Tiger still lurking amid the charred and battered terrain. The brigadier examined the plastic face and swollen carcass of his fallen adversary, the insignia and pistol and the contents of his kitbag. He plucked the identity card from the chest of the dead man, and turned to proclaim the death of Velupillai Prabakharan, the \u2018Supreme Leader\u2019 of the Tamil Tigers, to the troops mustered around him. Then he beckoned to a staff member, who handed him a field radiophone, and rang through to the SLA commander based at the Ministry of Defence Joint Operations Headquarters in Colombo. Major General Sarath Fonseka in turn telephoned the news through to the man who had appointed him to lead the army: his former comrade-in-arms and now the most powerful man in Sri Lanka, the defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\r\n\r\nIf the Sinhalese possessed an equal to Prabakharan\u2019s ruthlessness, commitment and grit, it was the defence secretary, a yeoman from the island\u2019s Sinhalese south. Gotabaya was no politician or insipid bureaucrat. A tough fifty-nine-year-old former colonel in the SLA, he had fought in some of the hardest engagements against the Tamil Tigers in the 1980s, when he had very nearly been killed. In 2005, his brother Mahinda had enticed him back to Sri Lanka with a promise of full support for a war against the Tamil Tigers \u2013 should he win his own planned bid for the presidency. Gotabaya, then retired from the army and working as a computer manager at the law faculty of the University of Southern California, always believed the SLA had been consistently betrayed in the field by weak political leadership. Mahinda\u2019s prospective presidency promised revenge, glory and the possibility of a new political dynasty built on a military victory that had eluded the Sri Lankan government for almost three decades.\r\n\r\nWithin months of the end of the war in 2009, General Sarath Fonseka and Gotabaya Rajapaksa fell out with each other, with Gotabaya accusing the general of treason, and Fonseka accusing the defence secretary of war crimes. In 2006, however, with victory over the Tamil Tigers still a dubious and distant prospect, the two men had begun planning the eradication of the Tamil Tiger menace once and for all. They persuaded China to provide them with the arms they so badly needed, and began training troops and refining deployment and operational tactics in preparation for the bloody war that was to follow. For the duration of this final stage of the civil war, Fonseka and Gotabaya worked closely, buoyed by one military success after another, as the army slashed its way through Tiger defences to the north. That morning, after taking the news from Fonseka, Gotabaya informed his brother, the president, that Prabakharan was dead and Mahinda\u2019s place in history assured.\r\n\r\nBack in the northern marshes, four soldiers carried the bier carrying Prabakharan\u2019s body through a crowd of hundreds of weary and excited soldiers, each of whom raised his weapon above his head, like Roman legionaries cheering the fall of a Teutonic chieftain. Bearing their load steadily, they marched along a rivulet while troops lined the banks and leaned forward to snap pictures of the scene on mobile phones \u2013 images that soon spread throughout Sri Lanka and around the world to the watching and waiting Tamil diaspora. An army photographer caught the triumphal procession in a photo that made its way to the front page of the New York Times the following day. The lifeless and dishevelled body, picked over by so many hands, traverses a sea of smiling green-clad soldiers, whose outstretched arms might have been raised in a salute had it not been for the mobile phones grasped in their hands.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose higher, the soldiers slowly bore the bulky corpse through the muddy pools of the bog and lowered it on to a dry sandy bank for closer examination by an SLA forensic team. The experts studied the uniform and the great gaping wound in the skull. They compared the pudgy face with the few photographs that existed of the reclusive Prabakharan, including those from a family album that had been found in an abandoned bunker the month before. They also took a swab from his mouth for a DNA comparison with the body of his son, twenty-two-year-old Charles Anthony, anointed heir to the Tiger leadership, whose body had been recovered from the battlefield and positively identified just two days earlier.\r\n\r\nThe forensic teams had already identified the bodies of the other senior Tiger leaders as they were dredged from bogs or dragged from the dune faces where they had fallen. They laid the fighters in long, stinking ranks, their corpses engorged, burned and mutilated, their arms outstretched, their flesh marked by chemical burns or cyanide, their faces contorted. When their noms de guerre appeared in the television broadcasts that day \u2013 Nadesan, Puleedevan, Charles Anthony, Kittu, Manimekala, Kannadasan, Rangan, Arul Vendan, Anna Thurai, Soosei, Rangan, Thomas, Purani, Bhanu \u2013 they read like the rolling credits from an epic and familiar film, one that had been watched many times. It was a reminder of the peculiar intimacy of the savage conflict that had consumed this small island nation for thirty years. Each name had been a minor hero in the pantheon of Tamil fighters who stood up to the Sri Lankan security forces, men and women deified by the hopes of the Tamil people. Tamils in Sri Lanka and around the world mourned the deaths of their too mortal gods.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Cage<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"In The Cage, Gordon Weiss provides an incisive account of the formation, history, and bloody dissolution of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka.

Devon, his brother, would understand why it pleased Thomas enough almost to make him laugh out loud, except that the garish bubbling of half-thickened blood in his nostrils stopped him. He didn't want it getting any messier than necessary. Didn't want extra attention. Amendment: Devon would understand, but he would not approve. He'd know, bleeding made you impervious and repellent. No one gave you shit if you were bleeding. No one gave a shit about you. They gaped and made faces, but they left you alone. More importantly, bleeding proved the experiment might be working. The chewing gum had been a setback (who knew? actual vitamin C in Juicy Fruit) but he was on track again and soon to be unassailable.\r\n\r\nHe tilted back his head and pinched the nostrils lightly. Felt blood pooling at the back of his throat, swallowed; felt it seeping along his cheeks and lips, and gazed at the tranquil, seldom-observed ceiling of the bus - domed and riveted and blue-green - fixing his attention inward, on his movie. OK. Frame one, opening shot - Erebus and Terror at sea... Interesting how the voices of other kids faded, became tinny and inconsequential as soon as he had a picture in mind. Who cared about them? He blinked his eyes shut, sniffed again and exhaled steadily through his nostrils to keep the blood going. Drew up one knee and propped it against the seat-back in front of him.\r\n\r\nFrom the start, then. Frame one:\r\n\r\nOpening shot: exterior: the Erebus and the Terror on a sea more or less the same blue-green as that bus ceiling. No icebergs yet, no sign of land. Low-flying mist, and as the ships come closer, you see men on board, black-wearing and wrapped in wool. Cue distant dance music, accordions, mandolin and piano; mournful, ballad-inflected but melodic and mostly happy. This is a good day, despite the ominous backdrop - a joyous day. Roll-across subtitle: Day 107 of the Franklin Expedition to navigate the Northwest Passage. Stores just replenished in Greenland and closing in on Lancaster Sound. The true start of the adventure... or... the beginning of the end? Period rigging and period ships. Mid-1800's, waddling, flat-bellied bombers re-fitted for the Arctic, both ships loaded practically to the water with coal and provisions. Seagulls... no, strike the seagulls. Two-shot: Leaning at the railing of ship number one (Terror), a pair of men with pipes, talking, gesturing. Establishment shot of the ship, and panning around it to ship two (Erebus) with more sounds. Cut to fight scene aboard Erebus: sounds of flesh hitting flesh - good amped-up Hollywood fight sounds, wet crackle of breaking tissue, cracking ribs, wheezy punched out breaths. POW. THWACK. WHUMP. Close-up of a sailor's bloodied face. Ablebodied Seaman Thomas Work - one of the main characters and among the few men who will make it as far as Starvation Cove with Crozier. Shoulder-shot of other sailor's face, both men circling - Private William Braine (dead of mysterious causes in less than a year, but now very much alive). Both men are bearded and stripped to the waist, backs steaming in the cold, and ringed around by cheering sailors. Work's been goaded into this fight by insults, but because of a religious upbringing (maybe his inferior rank as well) limits his responses to self-defense. He won't strike until he has to. All of this you know from his stance: wary, apologetic, fists raised. Braine moves in suddenly for the headlock. Clamps a sweating arm around Work's head and squeezes, pops him a few good ones until Work breaks away again. They separate and circle. Camera dollies back to show the men from a distance, the whole ship-deck seen from above again, against a wind ruffled blue-green backdrop of vast emptiness - a kingdom of emptiness. From here it appears almost like they're dancing crabs, circling each other and swinging fists, music from ship number one mixing together with the action and the cheering, so, from this perspective, it all has the appearance of fun - brutal, sailor merriment...","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 -

(Emphasis in original)\r\n\u2014Strategic Plan, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, February 2003 <\/i>\r\n\r\nNearly every week, I take the bucolic drive between Charlottesville, Virginia, where I direct the University of Virginia\u2019s bioethics center, and my other home in Washington, D.C. On one of those drives a few years ago, I received a peculiar call on my cell phone. Like any loyal American, I pulled over before I answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Moreno?\u201d came a female voice on the line.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to talk to you about a matter, actually, it\u2019s a national security matter.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUh, yes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI read your book. I have been the victim of a government experiment and I need to talk to you.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs I had done many times, I explained to the caller that I was no longer working for the government on ethical issues about state-sponsored human experiments, that my top secret clearances had lapsed, and that I had long been back at my day job as a bioethics professor. I expressed sympathy about my inability to give her relief. Nonetheless, like others who have called or e-mailed me in the past eight years, she was sure I could somehow help her.\r\n\r\nMercifully, I lost the cell signal and the call.\r\n\r\n<b>Just Because You\u2019re Paranoid Doesn\u2019t Mean Someone Isn\u2019t Following You<\/b>\r\n\r\nI believe those who think they have been victimized by government mind control experiments are misguided. Yet, there are thousands of such persons. Many associate their ideas with conspiracy theories. I have worked for two presidential commissions and have been a member of several government advisory committees. During periods set aside for public comments in these meetings and in private conversations, I have heard many of these people provide seemingly lucid testimony about scenarios I find fantastic. Some of them are courageous and resolute in the struggle they perceive as having been foisted on them; others are distraught and terrified of what horrors the next day may bring.\r\n\r\nDespite the vast distance between their worldview and mine, I have long been impressed at the irreducible kernel of truth behind their bizarre obsessions: that interest in understanding and manipulating the brain, while always strong, has flourished in recent years, particularly among those scientists in the United States and elsewhere who have been sup- ported by the national security establishment. Often this interest is generally but misleadingly referred to as \u201cmind control.\u201d The tale of research on the mind\/brain is complex, rich, and rather odd; an offbeat slice of our social history.\r\n\r\nFascination with this idea that something like mind control is possible is by no means limited to the Western world. While I was lecturing in Pakistan in the spring of 2005, a senior psychiatrist told me that mind control by the CIA or other intelligence agencies is a common complaint of his patients. And just around the time I was in Karachi, the India Daily editorialized that \u201cdefense scientists and research engineers are busy all over the world in many countries trying to create the ultimate mind control machine that can make the enemy surrender without any fight,\u201d allegedly by manipulating the electromagnetic field around a person. Somewhat undermining the credibility of the newspaper\u2019s technology reporters was the further remark that \u201cthose who had a close encounter with aliens and extraterrestrial UFOs report that they communicate though their mind and so speech.\u201d\r\n\r\nA wide range of brain-related scientific endeavors, some as spectacular as mind control and others as mundane as political propaganda, has also been pursued in the interest of the defense of the nation. Moreover, the potential for emerging developments in the neurosciences and national security is indeed remarkable; old-fashioned notions of mind control are quite archaic compared with what is just over the horizon. The improvement of soldiers\u2019 war-fighting ability, brain-machine interfaces, and the use of drugs and other measures to confuse and disrupt the enemy are the sorts of approaches that are going to be developed over the next de- cades, driven by cutting-edge science. And that\u2019s not all. Recalling the epigraph at the top of this chapter, one might well wonder, for example, what \u201cthings\u201d the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has in mind to do \u201cat great distances.\u201d Later in this book, I will describe experiments in which a monkey has been trained to manipulate a computer mouse or a telerobotic arm \u201csimply by thinking about it.\u201d What else might be made possible? How might such capabilities be applied?\r\n\r\n<b>The Future is Now<\/b>\r\n\r\nDoing things at a distance is also mentioned in a 2003 written statement for a congressional committee by DARPA Director Tony Tether. The goal, he also said, is to exploit \u201cthe life sciences to make the individual warfighter stronger, more alert, more endurant, and better able to heal.\u201d DARPA\u2019s Continuous Assisted Performance (CAP) program, the statement continues, \u201cis investigating ways to prevent fatigue and enable soldiers to stay awake, alert, and effective for up to seven days straight without suffering any deleterious mental or physical effects and without using any of the current generation of stimulants.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese remarkable goals would be easier to dismiss if the agency did not boast such an impressive track record. DARPA\u2019s overall mission is to bring discoveries from fundamental research to bear on the requirements of today\u2019s warfighters, accelerating the pace of applicable discoveries. Among DARPA\u2019s accomplishments in its continuous effort to \u201cfill the gap\u201d between basic research and military use are the Saturn rocket, ground radar, the Stealth Fighter, and the Predator missile. DARPA-developed unmanned aerial vehicles have been used in Afghanistan and elsewhere. DARPA designed the computer mouse and, to give the mouse something to click for, the innovation that might prove to be the most socially transforming of them all: the Internet, first called the Darpanet. To be sure, about 90 percent of the agency\u2019s ideas fail, such as the one about a mechanical elephant intended to stalk Vietnamese jungles, but the ones that work are remarkable. As one high-ranking DARPA official put it, \u201cDARPA is about trying to do those things, which are thought to be impossible, and finding ways to make them happen.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuch mechanical, electronic, and biotechnological innovations require extraordinary foresight, intelligence, and patience. Unlike in other areas of government, in the DARPA framework decades of development are acceptable. Today, the agency is turning some of its considerable ingenuity to innovations in neuroscience. Early in 2006, DARPA announced its funding initiative for the coming fiscal year under the program \u201cApplications of Biology to Defense Applications.\u201d By my count, most of the agency\u2019s desired research proposals directly or indirectly involve the brain:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Biological approaches for maintaining the warfighter\u2019s performance, capabilities and medical survival in the face of harsh battle- field conditions;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Biological approaches for minimizing the after-effects of battle injuries, including neurotrauma from penetrating and non-penetrating injuries as well as faster recuperation from battlefield injury and wounds;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Approaches for maintaining the general health of deployed troops;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Bio-inspired systems;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Biomolecular motors and devices;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Biological approaches to the growth of materials and devices;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Understanding the human effects of non-lethal weapons;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Micro\/nano-scale technologies for non-invasive assessment of health (e.g., vital signs, blood chemistry);<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Technologies to enable remote interrogation and control of biological systems at the system\/organ\/tissue\/cellular\/molecular scales;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Investigation of the interactions between physical forces, material and biology (e.g., interface of biology with magnetics);<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Novel mathematical and computational approaches to characterizing and simulating complex biological processes;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>New technologies to drastically reduce the logistics burden of medical treatment in the field;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Advanced signal processing techniques for the decoding of neural signs in real time, specifically those associated with operationally relevant cognitive events, including target reduction, errors, and other decision-making processes;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Novel interfaces and sensor designs for interacting with the central (cortical and subcortical structures) and peripheral nervous systems, with a particular emphasis on non-invasive and\/or non- contact approaches;<\/li>\r\n \t<li>New approaches for understanding and predicting the behavior of individuals and groups, especially those that elucidate the neurobiological basis of behavior and decision making; and<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Technologies to engineer field medical therapies at the point of care, such as production of multiple drugs from a single pro-drug, or to adapt therapies for wide variations in body mass, metabolism, or physiologic stress.The secret of DARPA\u2019s success is not its funding\u2014at around $3 billion, its budget pales beside the research and development budgeting of U.S. spy agencies\u2014but its brilliant use of intellectual capital. Its \u201conly charter is radical innovation,\u201d according to its strategic plan. DARPA is a science agency, not an espionage outfit. (In fact, the agency historically has tried to stay away from spy projects.) It cycles top-notch scientific talent through its system just long enough that they don\u2019t get too jaded in their outlook. About 90 percent of DARPA\u2019s budget supports university research on vital human problems, including many basic medical studies. So although much of the science I will describe is DARPA-funded, and raises important policy questions, its largely open culture is generally praised by scientists as a smarter operation than the often more closed science programs of other national security agencies.Since its founding in 1958 in response to the Soviets\u2019 Sputnik satellite, DARPA has been the key Defense Department agency whose mission is the pursuit of highly speculative scientific possibilities. Ironically, partly because so much of the agency\u2019s funding has gone toward science that doesn\u2019t seem to have an imminent national security payoff, the U.S. Congress has threatened to cut its budget in recent years. Though DARPA is only one national security agency among others that seek to exploit new technology, its relative transparency has made it a kind of symbol and an easy target for critics. No wonder the DARPA alumni scientists I spoke with said that the agency is especially publicity-shy for an outfit that does mainly unclassified work. Yet, to \u201csell\u201d the Pentagon on a project, DARPA managers have to show that their idea fulfills some military need, however remote. So, what DARPA manages to get its Pentagon masters to fund tells something about what the military finds interesting. And, of course, not all DARPA projects are open access; the Stealth Fighter was one of the most closely guarded military secrets of the twentieth century.It\u2019s hard to assess the efficacy of other taxpayer money spent on science. The official research and development budget for the Department of Defense is around $68 billion. And that figure doesn\u2019t include related national security research efforts supported by the Pentagon\u2019s secret, or \u201cblack,\u201d budget, which in the 1990s was often estimated in the press at about $30 billion but is surely higher now. Assuming that the proportion of R&amp;D to operations in the secret budget is about the same as it is in the Pentagon budget, black R&amp;D funds would be in the neighborhood of at least $6 billion. But these numbers are highly speculative and shouldn\u2019t be relied upon. At best, they would reflect only line items that can easily change, and what is included in the category of \u201cresearch\u201d is somewhat arbitrary. In addition to uncertainties about how much is being spent on research in general, we have no way of knowing whether the CIA itself is also working specifically on the potentialities of the brain sciences and various methods of enhancing or impairing human performance. What is clear is that DARPA is only one of several government agencies deeply interested in these and similar possibilities and that, other than for DARPA, citizens can\u2019t get much access to information about how their money is used.Whatever the actual amounts at their disposal, the national security agencies spend a substantial portion of their resources on research support to some of our most brilliant scientists. In fact, our defense infrastructure is critically dependent on civilian talent, and vice versa. The results of this collaboration help advance basic scientific knowledge and can improve future health care, as well as address military and security questions. Someday, breakthroughs in the understanding and treatment of brain diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s might well be attributed to work paid for by DARPA. Techniques to study and augment the cognitive powers of healthy people, many examples of which I will describe later, might also prove effective in circumventing the destructive effects of these terrible diseases. As one Caltech professor told Nature magazine, \u201cThe military has always been visionary when funding neuroscience.\u201dThe onrush of discovery about the brain and the concomitant technological advancements suggests many areas of interest from the military or national security standpoint. Two of these, improving intellectual endurance and achieving mental control at a distance, are mentioned in DARPA\u2019s strategic plan. Others, such as memory enhancement and distant brain scanning (a device that could detect telltale blood flow in certain neural systems some distance from the subject), also hold interesting possibilities at the intersection of neuroscience and national security. Still others, such as a deeper understanding of the neural processes associated with stress and how to manage it, could affect the preparation of combat personnel as well as treating their stress reactions. This work not only offers to improve the human condition, it also presents formidable ethical questions that our society has barely articulated, let alone carefully ad- dressed: How far should we go to enhance human performance, particularly our intellectual and emotional capacities? What adjustments in social systems will need to be made in light of these developments? Will such interventions have unintended consequences for societal institutions? What long-term risks are faced by those who are first to go down these paths?\r\n\r\nThese questions are especially pointed when we consider that the nature of human conflict could undergo basic change as the new neuroscience is applied to war planning. In a sense, all warfare ultimately happens between our ears. If opponents believe they have been defeated, then that becomes the reality, hence the military\u2019s investment in psychological operations such as propaganda leaflets and disinformation, despite their uncertain payoffs. But if targeted interventions are made possible by the greatly enhanced knowledge of the brain and nervous system now being generated at a feverish pace in our top neuroscience labs, complemented by ingenious new engineering and pharmacologic products, the battle of the brain will have truly begun. The powers that can claim the advantage and establish a \u201cneurotechnology gap\u201d between themselves and their adversaries will establish both tactical and strategic advantages that can ren- der them dominant in the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\nBesides remarkable enhancement possibilities that stem from new knowledge about the brain and new technologies developed in part for nonmilitary applications, national security agencies are engaged in research and development on drugs and devices that work through the senses to affect the nervous system. \u201cNonlethal weapons\u201d include anesthetic agents, foul-smelling chemicals, and acoustic technologies that might be especially useful in civil disturbances and, in theory, morally superior to more violent measures that are out of proportion to the threat. But they are not so easy to control in the field and might run up against international treaties about chemical weapons.\r\n\r\nIt is ironic that discussions about national security often fail to include the optimal means of ensuring that people are safe to live their lives: keeping the peace. The sad fact is that there is a specific marketplace for the materiel of war, not of peace. On that front, it is important to learn what insights the neurosciences might give us into nonviolent means of settling disputes. Clearly, violence has been a constant theme of human history. But somehow, we have survived and, as a species, prospered. The neuro-scientific studies now taking place in laboratories, as in the case of medications intended to act as \u201ccalmatives\u201d in potentially violent situations, may point the way toward enhancing prospects of peaceful resolution. But the same work misapplied could diminish them.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Mind Wars<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Jonathan Moreno\u2019s Mind Wars covers the ethical dilemmas and bizarre history of cutting-edge technology and neuroscience developed for military applications.

Among his secret joys is the way the dry cleaner folds and boxes his shirts, the new-map sensation of the creases cascading over his shoulders and chest each morning. He likes that he knows what the competing interests in the room are at any given moment: Camilla Barber\u2019s predictable cooing about \u201csustainability,\u201d Martinez\u2019s operatic enthusiasm for x, y, or z, swelling with his Adam\u2019s apple in the hour before lunch, then retreating into an afternoon of spent indifference.\r\n\r\nEach night, the ancient elevator hoists Weston up to the sparse apartment where he finds himself amidst light and shadows, a furnace that talks him through the night in Hephaestian tongues. A cot does for him; he is not impervious to the image of himself sunken in four-poster opulence in a spread of red paisley satin, maybe backed in goosefeather, but recognizes the chances of this are remote. Sleep may be luxury and indulgence for some out there, those in the elegant apartments his eye falls on beyond his sill with its gouges and blackened wicks. For him, sleep is as crude and functional as fuel. It catalyzes him for eight hours of sifting through statistics, rendering diagrams and schematics, the endlessly rigorous and recursive tasks of engineering a veritable universe packed into fourteen point eight two four nine six (he can go on) square miles.\r\n\r\nA pragmatist! Very well, then, let them think it, though in reality it is no exaggeration to say that his \u201cplans\u201d\u2014if one is to call them that\u2014derive wholly from the dream-life that runs riot across the proscenium of his skull. If he were to reveal this, it would be dismissed at first, then, if he insisted, treated with suspicion, and finally he would be dismissed. It\u2019s not as if he proposes Raedmeon as surreal playground\u2014dripping, oozing plazas, grids with walkways and staircases spiraling up to their own nadirs, reservoirs that digest locals and belch the remains of the sun by dusk. Who, though, could possibly understand the way the orderliness he harnesses and maintains has its origins in his dream life? Least of all his colleagues, drab bureaucrats to a man (and Camilla Barber).\r\n\r\nWhen and how did he come to be The Bread Machine? At the holiday party one year someone arrived with a fresh-made loaf and they were all talking about it. Next thing you know he\u2019s spittle-lip drunk and someone\u2019s magic-markered some manufacturer\u2019s name in the ample region between his hairline and the eyebrows that he raises, by habit, in lieu of his voice. The moniker\u2019s no accident, though, never was\u2014it\u2019s too perfect an analogy for how he operates, and he dons it with pride. So into the Machine go the problems that beleaguer any self-respecting city: overcrowding, crumbling infrastructure, de facto segregation, inadequate power grids on nights of anomalous heat or cold, the bombardment of pollutions ocular and aural, the endless teeter between the chorus of the old and the sirenry of the new. Out come Proposals. Solutions.\r\n\r\n(or leastways Disasters Narrowly Averted).\r\n\r\nInto the Machine, too, go daydreams, the yearnings and desires of the 46-year-old eccentric loner whose lunch hours are spent browsing in the most unlikely locations\u2014pawnshops, restaurant supply stores, sequin-manufacturing concerns. He will not join them in the company cafeteria midway up the black cylinder they relocated to a couple of years ago, despite its panoramic views of the city. He needs to move in Raedmeon\u2019s streets, to sniff out the sources of its pumpernickel, needs to see if its homeless veterans have updated their cardboard pleas or of late changed their bandages. In taking all of this in, he\u2019s no saint, no deliverer of alms or answers; he is merely feeding the dreams that provide him with, for lack of a better word, his Ideas. After work he\u2019ll walk home through microcosmic cities of sheet-vinyl and salvage just across from the abandoned tanneries, all the while chewing on the pumpernickel loaf he bought earlier. The Bread Machine, indeed.\r\n\r\nWhat none of them knows about is the pinch of yeast that goes into the Machine: 450 mg. of Evanescet, sleeping medication not yet available to the general public, still in Experimental Trial Phase 3.3. No rat fatalities or illness beyond the usual side effects\u2014involuntary twitching of the whiskers, diminished proprioception. At staggering doses only, catastrophic kidney malfunction. In order to swallow such doses proportionate to his own body size, Weston\u2019s guy in the pharmaceutical industry assures him, he would have to slug pills all day long, quite literally alternating with coffee sips for hours on end. It would be virtually impossible to consume enough, his friend insists, to induce kidney problems even if, let\u2019s say for some reason, he wanted kidney problems. Let\u2019s just say you wanted kidney problems\u2014he likes the way the guy says it, smirky but winning, traits he doesn\u2019t see enough of at Urban Planning.\r\n\r\n(He tried imitating this friend for a day but it fell flat, and it was pointed out that something he said verged on harassment, so he dropped that tack at once).\r\n\r\nWeston, stooped-over, sloped with patience, a gift for waiting over the vast, cosmic sprawl of time his job demands, a knack for knowing and abiding by every procedure, doing everything fairly, hearing out all contractors and bidders, checking off all the boxes, refraining from jumping in until he\u2019s heard all parties speak, Weston will not, damnit, sit around and wait for the government to approve Evanescet for common, everyday use. He needs the stuff now, needs the way it makes him swim through nights like a glowing set of eyes, springs him sated from the cot at daybreak. He loves the galvanic vigor that lingers in him on the bus as it wends its way downtown through the Raedmeon he\u2019s helped make block by block. He\u2019s tried other means of inducing sleep\u2014drugs of the government-sanctioned variety, herbal blends, witches\u2019 incantations. Nothing comes close, and so far as he can tell his kidneys are stalwart as bighorn sheep.\r\n\r\nOn the bus this morning, he notes the tree-lined medians and open-air market, the vistas opened up by demolition and then the reassuring density of new construction encased in the fragile, spindly promise of scaffolding. Weston wants to cry out \u201cO\u2019 Evanescet!\u201d like it\u2019s some lover whose hips are enmeshed with his own, wants to sing the praise of this muse with a bard-like fervor. But he wills himself silent, yoking deep-diaphragm breaths to images of retirement, a mere eight years away. They\u2019ll send him off with a gold-plated Bread Machine; of that he has no doubt. By then, Evanescet will be procurable in patch or chewing gum, either that or banned utterly but available at the right price, scored in a dark alley in needle form. Note to self: preserve a handful of dark alleys. His upper lip twitches while he worries the pill-crumbs in the inner lining of his coat pocket with his fingers, relishing the thought of devoting himself fully at last to the Raedmeon he\u2019s been quietly constructing all along, one which would never appoint a committee, where the streets are lined with luminous balustrades, and planning means nothing other than dancing in the pineapple rotundas of an untranslatable night.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/

There are, of course, real differences between art and science: in science if another lab replicates your work, you call to congratulate them; in the arts your lawyer calls. Another difference is that no real work of science has ever made anyone laugh out loud.\r\n\r\nArts and Sciences at one point did mean \u201cPaintings and Stuff and Petri dishes and Stuff,\u201d to quote Zadie Smith.(1) But in the age of Twitter, Facebook and Buzznet, arts and sciences follow YouTube\u2019s charge to \u201cBroadcast Yourself!\u201d These days one click on Twitter separates Shawn Corey Carter (Jay-Z), a rapper who is CEO of Roc-A-Fella Records and who owns the NJ Nets, from Eric Kandel, our leading neuroscientist and who owns a Nobel Prize.(2) Walter Benjamin, the \u201cpopular wise guy\u201d1 had it right: every reader has become a writer \u2013 or tweeter \u2013 in the age of electronic reproduction.\r\n\r\nMy essays play off one or another discovery of today\u2019s biological science (with epigenetics leading the pack) against one or another aspectof popular culture: film, television, sports, etc. (with Twitter et al leading the pack.) We\u2019ll see what the molecular biology of aging has to do with Sarah Palin\u2019s hair, why a Nobel prize for reproductive biology clashed with J-Lo\u2019s notion of fertility, and why the name on Oklahoma State\u2019s football stadium (T. Boone Pickens) scuppered basic research on anthrax.\r\n\r\nTwitter first. To learn what Twitter could do for me, I signed up a couple of years ago under the nom de silico \u201cFranz Anton Mesmer,\u201d (1734-1815) or franzmesmer@twitter.com. Sure enough, I soon had half a dozen \u201cfollowers.\u201d I told this to a psychiatrist friend of mine, who was astonished that anyone would follow the words of a dead hypnotist. I pointed out that this was the basis of organized religion, not to speak of Freudian analysis.\r\n\r\nWhile Twitter is the latest effort of popular culture to see how little one can say to the largest audience, epigenetics is the latest twist on the historic nature\/nurture debate in biology. Epigenetic changes are short-term heritable alterations in gene expression that are not due to mutations in DNA. An analogy: if DNA is a language composed of the letters A,T,G,C, epigenetic changes are like variations in a letter\u2019s font, i.e. C to C, or its context, i.e. C to \u00a9. We\u2019ve pieced together some of the machinery that accomplishes this trick, but we\u2019re still at sea as to how it all works.(3)\r\n\r\nDarwinian evolution \u2013 the origin of species \u2013 takes place over eons: epigenetics prints short-term bar codes on our cells so that they remember where they\u2019ve been and where they should be going. If they get lost, we call it cancer, obesity or diabetes. Since epigenetic changes can be induced by diet, drugs and the environment, there\u2019s a whiff of Lamarck about the whole notion.(3) Not to worry, though: until the genome crumbles, our skin will remain skin, our bones remain bone and apes won\u2019t turn into humans tomorrow. One trend is sure, though: nurture is gaining on nature in the old debate.\r\n\r\nEpigenetic explanations have been extended to reach Woody Allen\u2019s second favorite organ, the brain. If the gonads (Allen\u2019s favorite) are the organs of classical evolution, the brain is the organ of personal and cultural evolution. Neurobiologists now believe that our brains evolve through a series of choices made by individual neurons over time. These choices are made under epigenetic control and, as in classical evolution, are forged by selective pressure with adaptive advantage.(4) Growth, learning and remembering take place in the real social network: Imagine the very different selective pressures acting on the neural networks of young women growing up in Kabul or Minneapolis.\r\n\r\nMy essays touch on the social network we call Western civilization: Antoine and Anne-Marie Lavoisier, Emerson and Margaret Fuller, Gustav and Alma Mahler; Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells. Experimental science, I\u2019m convinced, is a crowning achievement of that civilization, and the fact that women now function as equal partners in science is a welcome sign of its continuing vitality. Several of my chapters in this book deal with the many women of science - from the martyred Hypatia of Alexandria, the first woman scientist, to the Nobel laureates Marie Curie, Christine N\u00fcsslein-Volhard, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider. The list speaks for itself.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Epigenetics

Cross over now, petits enfants! Pelagia was rejected by Diveyevo\u2019s nuns, scourged and beaten as she twirled about breaking windows with stones and generally acting completely out of her head. Abbess Xenia assigned her a companion who beat her with a stouter stick than anyone, yet unlike ordinary people, Pelagia rejoiced in her chastisements, for the Holy Fool\u2019s fate is to turn the universe upside-down, dodge moral lassitude and rise above the Great Human Myopic. A Fool-for-God liberates herself through humiliation, climbs heavenward up a steep, lonely incline of lunacy.\r\n\r\nAll at once, Sister Folly stopped twirling and settled into a routine. Squatting in the courtyard of the convent, Pelagia chipped a trough in the dirt, a mock catacomb, using a spoon stolen from the trapeza or refectory. Filling the niche with manure, she sat down in shit, spooning dung into her gorgeous bosom. When her first companion died, she was given another, Anna Gerasimovna, with whom Pelagia would live out the next forty-seven years in a plain wooden cell on the edge of the forest, at a slight distance from the convent.\r\nFor a time, Pelagia collected large stones, rolling them, willy-nilly, into the cell she shared with Anna. She slept in the dirt by the open door, stepped upon, spat at, taunted. Like naughty children, Diveyevo\u2019s nuns devised sly tricks and impious pranks to torment their demented sister. No longer was the question how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, but how many evil nuns can jump up and down upon the prostrate body of Pelagia as she howled and whimpered with delight? How scalding can the well water be that they dribble over her head, drenching the foul, unwashed tree roots of her once-yellow hair?\r\n\r\nDone with hauling rocks, Pelagia began sailing bricks into a murky frog pond, wading in up to her broad hips before hurling them back onto shore again. She didn\u2019t mind the army of emboldened frogs who hopped into her cell and hunkered, croaking voluptuously, in damp, foul corners. One day, Anna, who had had enough, swept the frogs, like so many green, slimy doorknobs, into a pile, tossed them out by their legs, then locked Pelagia inside. Holy Folly retaliated by pulling the door off its hinges, setting it on fire, and sitting in the pond overnight. After that, the two women dwelt in their forest cell, undoored, exposed to brutal Russian winters and insect plagued summers. Hear, too, that Pelagia never bathed or trimmed her huge, filthy finger or toenails, and was impervious to cockroaches, those shiny, black revulsions of the devil, skittering across the unhygienic humps and hummocks, the hairy tussock, of her unwashed body.\r\n\r\nIn time, a succession of miracles began to occur. Anna witnessed Pelagia deliberately jump upon on a board with a great iron nail sticking up from it, driving the rusted point straight through her high, naked arch. Rushing off to slap together a black bread and onion poultice, Anna returned to find no mark at all, not even a red dot, on Pelagia\u2019s stinking, sprouting potato of a foot.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Pelagia took to roundly thrashing herself with switches and sticks, another Holy Fool, a fellow Arzamassian, Theodore Mikhailovich Solovyov, showed up, and with Anna looking on, (terrified but willing to be glorified by martyrdom,) the two, matched in girth, began a fierce dueling of sticks and warring words. Like actors in some divine improvisation, they fought with clubs and branches, hurling insults like flaming javelins, like lightning bolts as they chased one another back and forth through the cell and into the Church of the Nativity cemetery.\r\n\r\nWhen the bruised and muddied Pelagia began uttering streams of pure clairvoyance, pilgrims straggled then elbowed their way into Diveyevo from far and near to be blessed, healed, beaten and screamed at. She predicted dates of birth and more often, death, and on the day Sergei Vasileivich, some hundreds of miles distant, fell mortally ill, Pelagia mimed his agony and howled like a wolf the instant his soul broke free from his spent, vainglorious body. Even the Tsar, dressed in the clich\u00e9d disguise of a woodcutter, made his way on foot through the forest to seek counsel from the reputed saint, later claiming she was the one person who would talk with him forthrightly and without guile. Still, when she warned him of his downfall, he did not listen, which proves that even in the presence of a seer and a saint, people hear only what they want to hear.\r\n\r\nOn they came in droves, day and night, seeking out the vile, stinksome creature sitting on her felt mat, asking their Matrushka what they should do about this or that or the other. To one she might scream \u201cHussy!\u201d and deliver a stinging slap to the cheek along with a riddle, to another she might coo a lullaby, tender a silky caress. Wealth and rank offered no insulation from her unpredictable clairvoyance. When Venerable Vladyka Nectary paid an unannounced visit, Pelagi stood waiting faithfully for him in a blinding hailstorm, yet when he named a replacement for Diveyevo\u2019s abbess, she boxed both his ears, making of him a devotee, her faithful one.\r\n\r\nEating only raw mushrooms, Pelagia hoarded the many offerings of sweets she received. Candies, cakes, prosphora, or holy breads, all were stuffed into in a lumpy homemade sack, or \u201cstorehouse,\u201d which hung from her neck, bending her by its dulcet, rotting weight, nearly to the ground. In Pelgia\u2019s final years, Anna Gerasimovna began to wake nights to find their cell on holy fire with the terrifying radiance of supernatural visitors. Father Seraphim, many years dead and a venerated saint, arrived to administer the sacraments, and Anna claimed to have seen, with her own eyes, an angelic being descend through the roof, whisk Pelagia off in its alien arms, and then return her, babbling incoherently, at dawn.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1879, Anna Gerasimovna woke one morning to find Pelagia outside, standing near the edge of the forest, in extreme austerity, an orant, arms upraised, wearing only her sarafan, a long, sleeveless undergarment, its thin hem nailed by ice to the snowy crown of earth. A caryatid made of flesh and ice, Pelagia upheld, for one night, the harsh, sorrowing, human world.\r\n\r\nOn January 30, 1884, she contracted a high fever and, enclasped by a dry, withering rosary of nuns, seemed one moment to battle invisible demons, the next to be lifted up in beatific rapture. At the last, she raised her head a little, its golden nimbus stinking of manure, frogs and rotten cakes, cried O, Mother of God! then fell back, asleep in the Lord, upon her pillow of iron shackles. An ocean of candles flared up throughout Russia. Panakhidas, memorials, were held everywhere, and overnight, painted icons, mosaics, carved panels of ivory and cloisonn\u00e9 enamels, images of Pelagia, Fool-for-Christ, sprang up like stars. Thousands mourned Matrushka, their holy mother. Thousands spun in keening ecstasy.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The

By carefully observing and mathematically calculating the effects of gravity, Newton showed that one could predict the motions of the heavenly bodies. Reading Principia, John Locke was struck that generations of philosophers had been so preoccupied with their own comprehensive metaphysical systems that they failed to be open to the lessons of experience. Similarly, it seemed to Locke that abstract and interminable arguments about such \u201cproblems\u201d as whether human beings are naturally free lead political philosophy down a blind alley. The point is rather that people are at liberty to do what they decide to do and that government should focus on conduct. The people, too, should respect state sovereignty only insofar as the actions of the state redound to the protection of their rights, a social contract.\r\n\r\nLocke appreciated that Newton\u2019s scientific approach gave the lie to the notion that one had to be a philosopher or priest or king to know the nature of things. Rather, political liberalism is founded on the fact that sovereign authority has at most an incidental relationship to the truth, that insight into the nature of things is independent of power or social status. Enlightenment epistemology values a worldview\u2019s correspondence with reality, proven through demonstration, rather than its internal coherence alone; while the latter is considered a logical requirement and an aesthetic virtue, in itself coherence is not a criterion of knowledge. Ancient cosmologists went to great lengths to ensure the internal coherence of their Earth-centered universe, but elegance is not enough. Even the presumptive axiomatic statements that are the lawlike generalizations at the core of a system of statements about the world are themselves subject to disconfirmation by experiment.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson was famously preoccupied with both astronomy through Newton and political liberalism via Locke. Mathematical reason and empirical observation were not to be set off against each other as in pre-Newtonian philosophy, but viewed as complementary and, so much as possible given the limits of contemporary knowledge and opportunities for experiment, integrated. Thus, the pragmatic and progressive strains in American thought and Americans\u2019 self-understanding reach back to the founders and to their inspiration in Enlightenment figures like Locke and John Stuart Mill. The revolutionary generation largely accepted the Enlightenment\u2019s confidence in progress, the idea that through empirically-based administration of public affairs (known today as the policy process) it was possible to improve the human condition. In principle, these improvements were limitless. Yet the founders\u2019 experience with unreasonable established authority in matters of taxation and personal religious conviction led them to construct a system in which state authority was constrained: the famous \u201cchecks and balances\u201d of the three branches of government.\r\n\r\nThe founders reached a consensus on a republican form of government that was finally buttressed by not a democracy per se, but a constitution. An underlying motive for this cautious attitude toward democracy was anxiety about the fragility of social arrangements, of civilized mores. The dislocations associated with technological developments have long been a source of concern among social conservatives, as have any sudden eruptions in the political fabric. The father of Anglo-American conservatism, Edmund Burke, was famously and quite rightly alarmed by the chaos, criminality and corruption unleashed by the French Revolution; his visceral response was to invoke fealty to tradition. \u201cThe very idea of the fabrication of a new government,\u201d Burke wrote, \u201cis enough to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as an inheritance from our forefathers.\u201d Shocked by the betrayals and violence of the Terror, Burke was by contrast a brave and often lonely supporter of the American rebellion, perhaps because the colonial governments were not \u201cnew\u201d but longstanding, finally becoming irreparably alienated from a distant monarchy while still retaining English roots.\r\n\r\nIn sustaining a delicate balance of idealism and realism about human affairs the American founders adopted an attitude we might today call ironic but might be better called fallibilism. This term was used by an American philosopher a century after the revolutionary period to describe his philosophy of science: all statements about the world may be proven wrong, which anticipated the later positivist view that all empirical statements must be falsifiable. The founders were only too well-aware that events could surely have falsified their theory that popular self-government is possible. It was thus perspicuous of Jefferson to describe their project as the American experiment. As a man of science, he well knew that he and his colleagues could be wrong.\r\n\r\nThe founders\u2019 ironic, fallibilist vision of human beings and human society therefore led them to favor a popular government but one that was constrained by certain constitutional arrangements. Their version of an Enlightenment governing philosophy deserves to be thought of as pragmatic in two senses: first, that it would be put to the test in experience, and second, in their view of human nature as improvable but inevitably flawed. The latter sense of the founders\u2019 pragmatism led them to favor careful limits on state power. Key members of the revolutionary leadership were pragmatic experimentalists who were in a position to glimpse the coming emergence of the modern idea of science and the way that a nation could exploit the growth of knowledge. Jefferson provided perhaps the most obvious and, over the long term, concretely influential example with his authorship of the patent statute \u201cto promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,\u201d which set about to provide incentives for inventors that largely remain in place and are still exceptionally generous. Jefferson saw intellectual property as providing both a magnet for creative individuals and a source of improvements for the common good.\r\n\r\nWe have recently come to know Jefferson as more flawed, complex and interesting person than his former misty image as the sage of Monticello. Not debatable is his intellectual brilliance. While Secretary of State, Jefferson personally reviewed each one of the first set of patent applications, later confessing his insecurity as an examiner ill-prepared to take on fields that were already showing signs of specialization. His preoccupation with the design of immensely clever gadgets was a traditional technologist\u2019s approach uninformed by theory. One senses in Jefferson a deep curiosity about underlying processes that were invisible to him, but the time was not yet fully ripe for applied science. Similarly, Benjamin Franklin\u2019s interest in electricity and metallurgy manifested themselves in his invention of lightning rods and circulating stoves. To say that Franklin was obsessed with the value of experiment and observation is no exaggeration, even conducting experiments on temperature and atmosphere during his frequent perilous ambassadorial voyages across the Atlantic....","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Body

In the early part of the last century it was a favorite summer destination for landlocked Austrians who needed a touch of the sea. In late August of 1906, Boltzmann and his family left Vienna to spend a little time there. The decision to go seems to have been Henriette\u2019s, since Ludwig had agreed to teach at the University that fall and had felt the need to prepare lectures. Always there was that need, that nervousness, the deepening neurasthenia, perhaps. Even there amidst the high cliff, with its castle, where once Rilke had gone to write the Duino Elegies in the damp stone rooms of the Princess Maria von Thurn-and-Taxis, there seemed to be no peace. And with him came that constant companion, that sense of failure, the recognition that maybe, as his great adversary Ernst Mach had said toward the end, he was the last pillar standing, the last who believed that behind the cliff and the castle and the air that he breathed were the unseen molecules and atoms he had argued for all his life. At least there were some who believed that this sense of rejection is why he had done it, though not Meitner, who professed never to have understood, though she thought it might have been the depression, the \u201cblack dog\u201d that had come to visit.\r\n\r\nHis fifteen year old daughter, Eva, discovered him. While she and her mother were out swimming in the bay, he had hanged himself with a short cord from a window frame in their hotel. Eva, disturbed by his long absence, had gone back to the hotel to find him. It was she who had made the horrible discovery, one she would never speak of again. The papers in Vienna, the memorials at the University spoke of a man of brilliance \u201cwho had bestrode his time and his nation,\u201d but who, as Franz Exner said, \u201cenvious fortune had denied inner peace.\u201d\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIt was near the end of my first year, a lovely spring morning in Indiana. Rita and I were having breakfast at Curley\u2019s place and we were expecting Simsohn and Buckley to join us later for coffee. I had not yet found a project for my dissertation and was not even close. Rita told me she had enjoyed all of her science courses and was beginning to think she might even want to do research someday in physics or chemistry. Looking at her that morning she reminded me a little of the young Lise Meitner.\r\n\r\nI told her what I had been learning about Boltzmann\u2019s life and how I had come to see the creativity that lay behind his works. But also the struggles and doubts that had tortured him and, ultimately, the darkness that had forced his hand in Duino. He seemed to me now almost a martyr to truth, a secular saint.\r\n\r\nRita remarked how odd it sounded to her, especially after a year of chemistry, where atoms and molecules were treated as the furniture of the world, the tables and chairs of reality, that people in 1906 \u2013 a mere 58 years before our conversation \u2013 doubted the existence of atoms, mocked them in fact in prestigious gatherings, and considered Boltzmann a throwback to an earlier age. I could not have agreed with her more. It was impossible to believe that atoms did not exist.\r\n\r\nWhen Simsohn and Buckley arrived, they at least brought some positive news. Simsohn would be doing something in the laboratory of Norbert Muller, something with surfactants, and would be using the concept of entropy in his work. Boltzmann\u2019s concept, the very S that appears on the tombstone in Vienna. And with that Buckley recalled some lines from the California poet Robinson Jeffers, who had written about the stone-cutters and how, with marble, they challenged oblivion. I knew the lines, had encountered them as an undergraduate and could even recite them:\r\n\r\nStone-cutters fighting time with marble, you fore-defeated\r\nChallengers of oblivion\r\nEat cynical earnings, knowing rocks split records fall down\r\nScale in the thaws, wear in the rain. The poet as well\r\nBuilds his monument mockingly\r\nFor man will be blotted out, the blithe earth dies, the brave sun\r\nDie blind, his heart blackening.\r\nYet stones have stood for a thousand years, and pained thoughts\r\nFound the honey of peace\r\nIn old poems.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course the stone will never last, Buckley laughed, and Jeffers knew it. And Boltzmann, too. But that equation, well, that\u2019s another matter.\u201d\r\n\r\nBuckley had made some progress in the search for a project, but he seemed more interested in what had happened at Duino.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo\u201d, he asked, speaking in his resonant voice from behind a black beard that might have been down to his knees, do you know the Elegies?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd I told him not really.\r\n\r\n\u201c Well\u201d, he said, \u201cmaybe these lines fit the story you\u2019ve been telling Rita.\u201d\r\n\r\nSince Buckley had a poem for all occasions, I was sure, that in some way, possibly obscure to all but Buckley, they did.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, Professor Buckley, tell us,\u201d Rita laughed, glancing up at Curley who was smiling and pouring her a third cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nAnd Buckley recited some lines from the first of Rilke\u2019s Duino Elegies, begun, also, in the midst of Rilke\u2019s terrible depression.\r\n\r\nBut lovers are taken back by exhausted nature\r\nInto herself, as though such creative force\r\nCould never be re-exerted.\r\n\r\nWe all looked at each other, a little perplexed. But the lines sounded right to me. Though I told Buckley I would have to give them much thought.\r\n\r\nSo the morning ended, the cash register rang the way they did back then and from behind the counter Curley gave us his usual wave and his bright smile and thanked us for coming.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Boltzmann\u2019s Tomb<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Boltzmann\u2019s Tomb is a travelogue through the history of science by the award-winning Bill Green.

What we brought the Major (we had to bring him something) was news of recently fortified Italian camps, accompanied by troop movement along the entire western stretch of river, from the Bainsizza plateau down to G\u00f6rz. Battle was imminent, and the Italians looked determined to make it their last.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t their last, though. The Austrians expected a spring offensive, and our scouting confirmed this, but High Command\u2019s best guess was that the Italians would proceed more tactically than they had in the past, using diversionary incursions upstream to draw our divisions holding the three mountains away from higher ground, and then attacking with their seemingly endless supply of troops. But the Italians had learned nothing in two years of fighting, and the Emperor\u2019s generals learned that for all of its ethnic factions, diversities, and desertions, theirs was an army of men who would go to their deaths throwing stones at the Italians rather than give an inch of homeland.\r\n\r\nAnd so it began with little more warning than the suspicious activity Zlee and I and a few spotters reported to our command. At first light\r\non the twelfth of May, we had just come off a week\u2019s rest and were sitting in a good hide forward of our main trench, from which we had seen an artillery team in range. We wondered why they had exposed themselves so foolishly, but never thought to question our luck. The officer was easy to identify, as his gunners loaded and aimed their cannon. I reckoned him at five hundred and fifty yards, a long shot, but Zlee never second-guessed himself, or me. Windage was light and the morning air dry, and Zlee just brushed the trigger and I watched that man\u2019s head snap back and body crumble as though it had been relieved of its bones.\r\n\r\nAnd hell followed, 3,000 guns \u2013 long range, medium, trench mortars, everything \u2013 opened fire on us and every other Austrian position from Plava to the Adriatic for two days straight, so that no one or no thing could run, move, or even breathe, a hell in which I prayed to some lost God that I might die so that the banishment toward it would end as quickly as it began.\r\n\r\nThey say the earth is a soldier\u2019s mother when the shells begin to fall, and she is, at first, your instinct not to run but to dig and hold and hug as much of that earth as you possibly can, down, down, down into the dirt, with your fingertips, hands, arms, chest, thighs and feet, until you are like a child clinging with his entire body to comfort after a nightmare.\r\n\r\nBut minutes of this, then hours, and days, and you wonder: How many days? Because the earth herself can\u2019t stop shaking and disintegrating as the shrieks and howls rain in like otherworldly miscreations on wing who know \u2013 know! \u2013 where you are hiding and want not just to kill but to annihilate you, their hissing and infuriate ruts as they approach the last sound you\u2019ll ever hear.\r\n\r\nIn that initial wave, our forward position saved our lives. Lines flanking us to the right and left took hit after hit and the longer range guns seemed to be inching ahead with each bombardment, stalking our counter-battery fire, command posts, and supply dugouts, so that any response or counter attacks would have to struggle to follow. Yet the Italians seemed interested not in accuracy but fury, and Zlee and I pressed down beneath the cover of canvas we\u2019d used for camouflage and a wall of sandbags we pushed up to take shrapnel for four hours of nonstop shelling, some explosions so close I could feel air being sucked from my lungs.\r\n\r\nAt what we guessed was late morning there was a lull. We took our chances and threaded through the warren of dugouts, ledges and trenches that made up our forward line, the men still in positions that hadn\u2019t been completely destroyed looking like gray mannequins in a desolate uniform shop, some doe-eyed and terrified, others appearing resigned to their deaths already. The sergeant who had gone out with us to shoot deserters got hauled past on a stretcher by two bearers, his mouth opened in a scream we couldn\u2019t hear (for the bombardment had rendered us deaf) and his chest laid open so clean I could see his heart beating wildly beneath the bones of his rib cage. The captain\u2019s dugout had taken a direct hit. Nothing and no one there by the time we reached it but a horse on its haunches pawing the dirt, and the coppery stink of blood and burnt flesh all around.\r\n\r\nBy noon the Italians were at full force again, and we had made it to Major M\u00e1rai\u2019s tent just beyond the reserves. He said he wanted us to stay out of the lines and head back to Mount Santo where they suspected the Italians would attack in strength when the artillery barrage was finished. We were to take any shots we had on high value targets \u2013 officers, cannoneers, scouts.\r\n\r\nAfter a day\u2019s hike with a separate regiment, Zlee and I took position on the upper reach of Mount Santo in the ruins of an old monastery\u2019s gate house, long since reduced to rubble by artillery. The night before, we ate field rations of biscuits and hard tack with the same Croats who had fed us when we were ranging from those hills. And at dawn on the fourteenth, the Italians came over the top.\r\n\r\nThe brigade sent to re-take that mountain knew the mixed terrain on the western slope and had been hiding its regiments among the massive stones and stands of trees under the ongoing cover of artillery fire, so that the soldiers defending the mountain were caught off guard, weakened and shell shocked as they were, as wave after wave of Italian fanti burst from their positions like water from an earthen dam and charged up the steep and bald slopes of those hills, only to be mown down by our Schwarzloses and close range guns. By late morning, men barely seemed to touch the ground as they entered battle and died in one seamless move, so thickly strewn with bodies were those hills. The few that pushed on toward a trench or rock dugout were shot in the face with pistols, gutted with bayonets, or fought hand to hand, bravery and folly indistinguishable on both sides, until the Italians seemed a being that grew with death and for that reason was incapable of dying, and all we could do was follow our own who had survived and retreat down the steep back of Santo, so that by

They liked the food, the wheat berry salad and the fennel tart. They liked the beer, too, and would she come with him to school sometime to hear a reading of one of their plays, or a rehearsal, perhaps have lunch with them? Polite. The students were always so polite to her, and funny, they made jokes about him that amused her. Of course they were drama students, and so they were lively and performative, joyfully outrageous, on fire. Did she know that he talked about her in rehearsals, said \u201cI defer to my wife on this . . . .\u201d One young woman--she stood so tall--said, \u201cYou\u2019re his example for almost anything having to do with women.\u201d The young woman smiled and it was genuine, her ink-blue eyes glistening; she was the talent in the group, Benson said, \u201cit\u2019s too bad she\u2019s so tall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow we know why,\u201d said another young woman, and it took her a moment to realize this was a compliment to her, that they understood why she was a measure of womanhood, or homemaking or cooking. It referred to so much, this compliment, and she knew they were taking their notes here, now, in her home, their home, Benson and hers. It made her nervous most times having them here, so many sets of avid eyes. Some of it was sweet attention, the fact that they were at school and away from real homes, stable living situations with full batteries of pots and pans. They hadn\u2019t seen a four-square meal in days, nor cloth napkins and glasses that matched. They wandered the house looking at the paintings, or playing with the wicket in the front door, this bit of theatrical business, and today Benson had even directed them into their bedroom--really into their walk-in closet--to look at the original playbills from Odets\u2019 Clash by Night and Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s The Iceman Cometh. So many of them had stood in their bedroom, but one of the young men had plunked down on the bed, drinking his beer, one of his knees hiked up with his boot heel on the bed rail. It was just a length of wood, she said to herself, and his boot heel would do no damage. It was an old, old bed, one which she had brought to the marriage, a spool bed inherited from her southern aunt. They were reproducing them now, though this was an original from Louisiana, from the 1870s and made of West Indian mahoghany. She hadn\u2019t wanted it to be their bed, their marriage bed; it had seemed too grandmotherly, and Benson stretched its entire length and then some, but they were as poor as these graduate students were now, and had been happy to even have a bed. A small white panel truck delivered it to their New York apartment all the way from Shreveport, the men calling ahead to make sure someone was there in the three-story walk up to receive it. On the busy, filthy sidewalk when the moving blankets dropped from the turned rungs of the bed\u2019s footboard, a check, secured on one end with scotchtape, stood up like a playing card clothespinned to a bicycle spoke. On the back of the check was scrawled, \u201cBuy yourself a good mattress and boxspring, one which will take a lot of action! Love Tante Cece.\u201d She hadn\u2019t loved the suggestion of her aunt\u2019s note\u2014it embarrassed her--and even worse was the absurd amount, enough for five mattress sets. She worried that these moving men had read her aunt\u2019s ornate scrawl, had laughed their way up the eastern seaboard, and when Benson came striding down the street, waving, his face alight, he and the men had laughed and she heard the words \u201cwe brought the launchpad to the rocket,\u201d and the deep male laughter and she watched from the window the vigorous handshakes and Benson putting money in their hands. \u201cMy aunt already paid them,\u201d she said when Benson came up the stairs and in the front door. \u201cShe tipped them, too. You didn\u2019t need to give them money.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, why not,\u201d Benson had said. \u201cThey\u2019re in New York City. They need to play a bit.\u201d She had felt mean, a check for five thousand dollars in her hand and she stood there begrudging these men a little mad money.\r\n\r\nOf course, she and Benson bought a very fine mattress and boxspring, and because of this had used the bed for so long it became their bed and then, even longer into the years, after they had replaced that initial mattress set, it would have meant something too ominous to have changed out the bedframe . . . and then what would that preferred bed have been anyway? \u201cI can\u2019t hear you for this goddamn bed,\u201d Benson complained, its squeaking and moaning quickening over the years as the different climates dried out the old wood. Or Benson would ask, amused, \u201cIs that you or the bed?\u201d or he would ask, his lips against her ear, \u201cWas it as good for you as it was for the bed?\u201d but Benson loved Tante Cece and would not have hurt her for the world even if she might never have found out about them purchasing something new and less rickety. It was just something Benson wouldn\u2019t do in the world, and of course she had always agreed, had loved this observance in him.\r\n\r\nBut this summer, in the dense, unnerving heat, Benson moved her against the wall and ran his hands up under her wet arms and then up around her sticky neck. \u201cStop,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cstop. I\u2019m a sweaty mess,\u201d but he wouldn\u2019t and he turned and pressed her into the bed and said, \u201cI don\u2019t care\u2014you think I care about sweat. I want my mouth on you.\u201d That was his expression, he wanted his mouth on her, but she could not understand this desire, could not imagine allowing anything so disgusting. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, pushing his head from between her legs. \u201cNo. Why must you want this so much.\"\r\n\r\nHe jerked his face away from her hand. \u201cWhy indeed,\u201d he said and then he shifted his weight and rolled away and she raised her head to see him licking the mahoghany rungs of the footboard, \"chewing the scenery,\" a phrase she knew from him. And then she said as much, \"You're chewing the scenery.\"\r\n\r\nNow she shook the young man\u2019s hand who had sat on the bed, the bed that had strangely not made a peep. His hand felt grainy and thick and cold, but her hands were always too warm, clammy. \u201cI\u2019ve read your books,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThey were helpful to my family.\u201d\r\n\r\nOh, she thought, his hand falling from hers. She was always surprised when someone knew that she had done something other than stand by Benson\u2019s side as he told his students goodbye. It was not Benson who spilled the beans, and her \u201coh\u201d was in large measure her surprise that someone yet again had spoken about her, had identified her. What diligent soul in Benson\u2019s department took it upon himself?\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have a little sister,\u201d she asked the young man, \u201cor a sister, yes?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe eats now?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said again, \u201csort of,\u201d and then he was gone down the steps and she heard his boot heels against the brick, resonant and pronounced, the jostle of the buckles. She liked the way his black leather jacket hiked up his back. She could see his faded blue shirttail just coming uptucked. She liked these students; she liked them all, their tremendous vulnerable power. Then Benson had her by the shoulders from behind and pulled her into himself and kissed her on the top of the head. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back in,\u201d he said, and because he was an actor and he knew how to breathe, how to enunciate and project, his words blew hot across her scalp, as though even before she saw what she was about to see, the fire had begun.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome along, Mercutio,\u201d Benson said, \u201cthat knucklehead Romeo awaits your death.\u201d Benson\u2019s talent, the tall Meagan, turned and smiled at her; she clutched her purse to her side, intoned what so many of them had intoned, thank yous, appreciation, and then she passed out the door at Benson\u2019s insistence, his arms aloft, directing. The tall Meagan bowed awkwardly, a performance, stumbling into a funny drunken walk, and then she hung a moment on the iron gate delivering lines:\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, \u2018tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church-door, but \u2018tis enough, \u2018twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am pepper\u2019d\u2014\u201c\r\n\r\nBenson laughed and pulled the front door shut.\r\n\r\nInside, it was so suddenly quiet, even the music between tracks, and then slowly the deep sounds of Mingus fingering his bass. She stood looking at the door\u2019s panels and the iron wicket that rattled. She could open the little grille and look through, but she thought, no, don\u2019t. She walked into the front room and gathered glasses and napkins onto a tray. Two cashews remained in the nut bowl. They looked to her like huge commas, and she leaned down and plucked them from the bowl and ate them. Mercutio\u2019s lines, didn\u2019t they signal the turning point in the play, the comedy ending and the tragedy beginning? She moved to the front window and looked out. She thought \u201cthe talent\u201d and Benson well matched. They stood talking, first Meagan's head down with her hair falling forward, obscuring her face, and then his face down, and then her hands held behind her back and her lovely face tilted up to his. Benson knew an audience at his back when he had one, and he never touched her, never even leaned down to kiss her on the cheek--blameless--but this was how she, his wife in the window, knew. All theater people hugged and kissed all the time. They were crazy for it.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/

Over thirty feet in length and fifteen feet high at the shoulder, the tusked wonder dwarfed visitors to Koch\u2019s eclectic St Louis Museum. He called it Missourium theristrocaulodon, the Leviathan from Missouri.\r\n\r\nKoch had exhumed the remains of his star attraction not far from the lush banks of the Pomme de Terre River in Benton County, Missouri, the previous year. Among scraps of fossilized swamp moss and cypress trees were the bones of several individuals, and Koch cobbled together their bones to construct a beast that seemed larger than life. Patrons flocked to the museum to marvel at its enormous tusks and tree-sized limbs.\r\n\r\nKoch\u2019s Missourium proved popular enough that he decided to expand his audience. The beast was to go on an east-coast tour, and one of the first stops was the Masonic Hall in the bustling port city of Philadelphia. Crowds came to gape at what Koch sold as the ruler of the Antediluvian world, but mixed among the curious members of the public were representatives of the city\u2019s prestigious community of naturalists.\r\n\r\nOne of the first naturalists to examine Koch\u2019s work was the anatomist Paul Goddard, and he immediately knew something was wrong. Koch\u2019s Missourium was not a new creature but was already familiar to naturalists as a mastodon, an extinct elephant given the name Mammut americanum. Even worse, Koch had erred in his reconstruction by adding extra ribs and vertebrae to inflate the stature of the already gigantic proboscidean.\r\n\r\nKoch\u2019s lack of academic training and his sensational promotion of his specimen did little to help him. Had he deliberately manufactured an imaginary creature or was he just ignorant of palaeontology? Accusations and counter-accusations circulated through Philadelphia\u2019s scientific community, but Richard Harlan, another local anatomist and polymath, took the middle ground. After studying the skeleton himself, Harlan could only conclude that Koch had simply made a few honest mistakes. Surely, now the errors had been exposed, the extraneous bones would be removed.\r\n\r\nIf Koch agreed with Harlan\u2019s assessment, he did not let on. When the skeleton was erected in London\u2019s Egyptian Hall later the same year, it appeared with every extra bone in place. Now, however, it had some competition. The scaly representatives of the recently described (and soon to be named) Dinosauria threatened to overshadow the Missourium. So Koch played up the might and size of his ancient pachyderm. A broadside poster proclaimed:\r\n\r\nThis unparalleled Gigantic remains, when its huge frame was clad with its peculiar fibrous integuments, and when moved by its appropriate muscles, was Monarch over all the Animal Creation; the Mammoth, and even the mighty Iguanodon may easily have crept between his legs.\r\n\r\nSuch fanfare did not deceive British naturalists. Even though the Missourium was greeted with enthusiasm by some members of the London scientific elite, in 1842 the anatomist Richard Owen pointed out the spare ribs and vertebrae that his American colleagues had previously noticed. Koch passionately defended his reconstruction before the Geological Society, but the British scholars were not convinced.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of this controversy, Koch took the skeleton on tour elsewhere in Europe, yet the London scientists had not entirely soured on Missourium. Despite Koch\u2019s overblown claims, it was still an impressive and valuable mastodon skeleton. When Koch stopped back in London in November 1843 at the end of the tour, the British Museum purchased it for \u00a31,300. This was enough to enroll the Koch children in a school in Dresden, Germany, while the palaeontologist and his wife travelled the European continent. All of Koch\u2019s hard work had paid off.\r\n\r\nBy 1844, however, Koch was itching to head back into the field to rebuild his collection. A fossil-hunting trip through the United States would be just the thing, and as soon as Koch arrived in New England he started prospecting the local outcrops for choice specimens. Shells, shark teeth and a few bones rewarded Koch\u2019s efforts, but what he was really after was another monster. The Yale professor Benjamin Silliman, a close friend of Koch\u2019s, would be instrumental in providing him with one.\r\n\r\nWhen Koch stopped in New Haven, Connecticut, to visit Silliman on 17 August, he had his entire array of fossil treasures in tow. Silliman was impressed with what his friend had already accumulated, but he knew of another place where there were even more impressive bones to be found. In parts of southern Alabama, local residents had found the abundant remains of an enormous sea-serpent, and Silliman knew a woman who could tell Koch where to chisel his own sea monster from the rock. They went off to meet her at once. If Koch could obtain these remains then he would surely have a new attraction unrivalled by any other.\r\n\r\nWith directions to the monster graveyard in hand Koch soon continued on his way through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Missouri, picking up fossils as he went. He finally reached Alabama on 20 January 1845, but the fossils he sought proved elusive. It would be another month before he would first catch sight of them, and they would not be in the place he expected. On 14 February, Koch was on his way to meet an acquaintance in Macon County when he spotted an enormous, charred vertebra lying in a fireplace. It could only have come from the sea serpent.\r\n\r\nWhen he asked about the scorched bone, Koch was told that it had been used for nearly three years as a fireplace support, and this was only one of the ways in which the plentiful fossils were regularly destroyed. During his travels, Koch saw the gigantic vertebrae used to prop up a fence, as a cornerstone in a fireplace, as a slave\u2019s pillow, and had even heard of a man who thought he could extract lime from the fossils by burning them. (All he got for his trouble were burnt bones that crumbled to pieces.) Indeed, the bones were so numerous that in some fields they were destroyed because they interfered with cultivation of the land, and the widespread waste of the petrified treasures troubled Koch. As he wrote in his journal it was a shame that so many fine specimens were \u2018snatched from science by ignorance\u2019.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the

Their arrival also brought an end to German nuclear research, and captivity to the German nuclear scientists. V-E (Victory in Europe) Day in May was followed three months later by the capitulation of Japan under the shadows of the mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\r\n\r\nThe perceptions and rationales that Heisenberg and many other Germans accepted before and during the war enabled them to continue their work and daily lives under Hitler\u2019s regime. But as the circumstances changed with the collapse of the Reich, the rationales collapsed with it. While many Germans reacted with shock and bewilderment in the wake of defeat, they also began to construct a new rationale tailored to their new world and the questions that arose about their past.\r\n\r\nThe postwar era brought with it the realization of two terrible truths. The first came with the disclosure to the world of the utter depravity of the Nazi regime, exemplified by the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi death camps. The second truth to be faced was the awesome destructive fury of nuclear weapons, a fury unleashed through the genius of scientific and technological research. Both of these truths had ramifications that went far beyond the immediate experience of the war, changing forever our perceptions of human progress and human potential. They taught us to be skeptical of so-called modern, enlightened societies, however cultured, and, for many, to be wary of modern science, however promising. While each person, and especially each nuclear scientist on both sides of the war, struggled to come to terms in his or her own way with one or both of these terrible lessons, Heisenberg, having much to explain, took a leading role in publicly articulating the reactions of leading German scientists.\r\n\r\nAs newspapers around the world blazoned reports of Nazi atrocities uncovered by Allied troops during the spring of 1945, the public remained unaware of nuclear weapons until the destruction unleashed on Japan in August. The German nuclear scientists, who thought their research at least equal to, and probably far ahead of, Allied research, supposed that the Alsos mission had captured them in early May in order to tap Germany\u2019s superior knowledge. The day after Heisenberg arrived at the Alsos outpost in Heidelberg, he was ushered to an interrogation on his work by his erstwhile colleague, Samuel A. Goudsmit, the scientific head of the Alsos mission.\r\n\r\nHeisenberg and Goudsmit had last seen each other in Ann Arbor shortly before the war. Much had happened since. Now, as Goudsmit faced the man he had looked up to as a young physicist but who had apparently made little or no effort to rescue his parents from transport to Auschwitz, the German physicist seemed to him despicably haughty and self-involved. Heisenberg, for his part, seemed to welcome the attention the Allies accorded him for his wealth of nuclear knowledge. The extraordinary efforts that Pash had made to arrest him reinforced such pretensions. When asked about his nuclear research, Heisenberg was so confident of its significance that he offered to instruct the Americans on uranium fission. Goudsmit, knowing of Allied progress, though not about an imminent bomb, politely thanked him for the offer.\r\n\r\nOn impulse, Goudsmit repeated his question of six years earlier: \u201cWouldn\u2019t you want to come to America now and work with us?\u201d Heisenberg repeated the answer he had given earlier: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to leave.

Barash (an evolutionary biologist) and Judith Eve Lipton (a psychiatrist), stunned the public by making the case that monogamy is extremely rare in the animal world; that it simply isn\u2019t \u201cnatural\u201d\u2014for animals or for human beings. The response was dramatic: fascination mixed with outrage; vindication for some, apoplexy for others. <em>The<\/em> <em>Myth of<\/em> <em>Monogamy<\/em> clearly touched a nerve: If monogamy is unnatural, is it hopeless?\u00a0 Is infidelity inevitable?\u00a0 And what about the paradox of a happily married husband-and-wife writing that monogamy is in any sense a \u201cmyth\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>In <em>Strange Bedfellows,<\/em> the much-anticipated stand alone sequel to <em>The Myth of Monogamy<\/em>, the authors answer these questions and in the process, reassure and empower anyone nervous about his or her monogamous future.

And how, when it comes to love and marriage, biology is not destiny. Unlike other species, we can overcome our biological urges\u2014and are at our most human when we do so!<\/p>\n<p>As in all of Barash and Lipton\u2019s books, the lessons in <em>Strange Bedfellows<\/em> are served with a good amount of humor and humility.

The phrase actually comes, however, from Shakespeare\u2019s play The Tempest, and was originally somewhat different. A drunken jester named Trinculo has just been shipwrecked on Prospero\u2019s magic island. The storm is still raging, and Trinculo seeks shelter under the ragged garments of the resident monster, Caliban. \u201cMisery,\u201d says the resigned but desperate Trinculo, \u201cacquaints a man with strange bedfellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.\u201d Centuries later, in 1850, one Charles Dudley Warner, editor of the Hartford Courant, modified Trinculo\u2019s tribulation to \u201cpolitics makes strange bedfellows.\u201d Equating politics with misery, it appears, is nothing new. Our point is that biology, too, creates strange bedfellows, especially when it comes to mating and marriage.\r\n\r\nIt is endlessly fascinating to learn who ends up in bed with whom, and for how long, and with what secrets. There are always great surprises, scandals, and scenes. The princess is betraying the prince with a dashing horseman, as the prince betrays the princess as well. The heir apparent falls for a \u201ccommon\u201d woman and gives up his kingdom. The president has a messy sexual relationship with a young intern. One gorgeous movie star abandons his lovely wife and children for another spectacular movie star\u2014of one sex or another. Other celebrities boast of their promiscuity and sexual track records. This is the stuff of People magazine and other tabloids, because\u2014let\u2019s face it\u2014people want to know who are the strange bedfellows du jour.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, by contrast, monogamy is boring, not only for each couple but for the gossiping public. Who cares if two people have been faithfully devoted for decades? It is the departures that make the headlines, except for those rare cases in which a mateship persists for 75 years or so. The point of this book, however, is that monogamy is interesting in itself, and that the strange bedfellows who make it permanent may not necessarily do so in a context of misery. In the 1960s, a pair of our friends were accused of living in \u201cunmarried bliss.\u201d The question presents itself: Is it possible to be married and blissful, or at least monogamous and satisfied? Is it possible for human beings to be monogamous at all?\r\n\r\nCertain situations\u2014typically, demanding ones such as storms or politics\u2014predispose toward outcomes that involve unlikely combinations. The psychology of mating also creates situations of this sort, because if nothing else, it is highly unlikely that the inclinations of any one individual will be identical to those of another, whether or not the two are matrimonially united. Instincts and desire are actually composites of many things, some of them pointing in contradictory directions. Specifically, as we shall see, human biology predisposes Homo sapiens of both sexes to seek sexual variety and multiple partners, thus undermining monogamy. But at the same time, the chief argument of this book is that biology does not preclude monogamy; in fact, there are certain evolutionary factors that resonate strongly with monogamy, offering shelter from infidelity\u2019s storms.\r\n\r\nAnd make no bones about it: infidelity makes waves. This is not to say that open relationships or other sorts of arrangements don\u2019t also cause mayhem, but rather that infidelity (cheating, deception, philandering) nearly always causes substantial trouble for human beings, as for other animals. Deliberate and careful monogamy can provide shelter from these storms of betrayal, but not without taking its own toll.\r\n\r\nMonogamy itself can be tempestuous, among animals no less than human beings, and just as biology often threatens to capsize so many matrimonial boats, it also\u2014ironically, but no less genuinely\u2014 offers at least the prospect of stability. Either way, everyone is Trinculo, seeking refuge under less than perfect circumstances. And to understand Trinculo, it helps to look hard at Caliban, and perhaps to conclude, as did Prospero in The Tempest: \u201cThis thing of darkness I acknowledge mine.\u201d","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Strange

There was no \u201cAbout the Author\u201d page in the back of the book. Curious, I checked an encyclopedia and other reference sources at home. Still nothing. Surely there must be a biography of the man, I thought, as I logged on to the public library\u2019s online catalog. Alas, \u201cNo matches found.\u201d So, too, said Amazon as well as those usually trusty procurers of the obscure, the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers, which struck me as odd. Gray\u2019s Anatomy is widely considered one of the most famous books in the English language and is the only medical text most people know by name. Gray\u2019s has been cited as a major influence by figures ranging from fitness icon Jack LaLanne to the artists Jean-Michel Basquiat and Kiki Smith. Fascinating \u201cbiographies\u201d have been written about every- thing from the number zero to the color mauve, yet there is not one on Gray. Can he simply have gone unnoticed by historians, been taken for granted, as he had by me till now?\r\n\r\nWell, no, there was a far more reasonable explanation: when trying to piece together the life of Henry Gray, the unknowns simply outnumber the knowns. What I discovered through additional digging at local libraries, in fact, is that surviving records are more extensive about his father.\r\n\r\nThomas Gray, born in Hampshire, England, in 1787, was a private messenger to King George IV, a position in which he was entrusted to carry the most sensitive of documents, including, one can assume, the love letters sent back and forth between George and Maria Anne Fitzherbert, the king\u2019s secret, illegal, and Roman Catholic wife. Thomas Gray later served in the same capacity for George\u2019s successor, William IV, which suggests that he possessed a remarkable ability to be discreet and inconspicuous\u2014a trait that he seems to have passed on to his son. To this day, it is not known where or when exactly Henry Gray was born. The year 1825 has been suggested, but 1827 is generally more agreed upon. Similarly, where he spent his earliest years is uncertain. Some historians cite London while others suggest Windsor, England, while others, connecting imaginary dots, say the lad was raised in Windsor Castle, a commoner among royalty, which is an enchanting notion but nevertheless wrong. When Henry was around three years old, Thomas Gray moved his family\u2014wife Ann and Henry and his three siblings\u2014into a house near Buckingham Palace, but the address itself, No. 8 Wilton Street, is the only verifiable fact of his boyhood. It is almost as if Henry Gray did not fully exist as a flesh-and-blood being until the sixth of May 1845, the day he stepped inside London\u2019s St. George\u2019s Hospital and signed his name to the register as a medical student.\r\n\r\nFrom this point forward, one can retrace his path by way of exams passed, awards won, and scientific papers published, all of which are noted in official records. Among the major milestones: Gray received the equivalent of an M.D. in 1848, and four years later, at the precocious age of twenty-five, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, an exclusive group of scientists that had counted Isaac Newton and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek among its members. Still, I found it maddening that I could not scrape together more. While I had long since missed my chance at a medical career, I\u2019d begun to hope I could make a contribution to the field as Henry Gray\u2019s biographer. But what I had gathered about him thus far would amount to little more than a CV. No anecdotes or reminiscences about him seemed to have survived. His rise through the ranks of St. George\u2019s is marked merely by the titles and dates of his positions, as if the man, like one of his book\u2019s drawings, were just a neatly tagged specimen: postmortem examiner (1848), curator of the Anatomical Museum (1852), lecturer in anatomy (1854), and so forth.\r\n\r\nCritically praised author was added to the list in 1858. Anatomy, Descriptive and Surgical, as Gray\u2019s tome was originally titled, received excellent reviews, sold well, and was picked up by an American publisher the following year, by which point he was already working on a revised and enlarged second edition. In what came as a complete surprise to me, however, Gray did not create any of the book\u2019s nearly four hundred signature anatomical drawings. These were the work of another Henry, one Henry Vandyke Carter, whose contribution was not even credited in the 1901 American edition of the book that I own. While this revelation raised a slew of new questions, others were put to rest when I learned how Henry Gray\u2019s story ended: On Wednesday, June 12, 1861, he was scheduled to appear before the board of governors of St. George\u2019s Hospital. As one of three finalists for a prestigious surgical position, he was expected to make a brief statement on his own behalf. But he never showed up. And word eventually reached the panel as to why. Henry Gray had died that very same day. When all the details emerged, it turned out that he had contracted smallpox while treating his young nephew who was suffering from the disease. Ten-year-old Charles Gray recovered and went on to live into his fifties, but Henry, who had been vaccinated against smallpox in childhood, died at his family\u2019s longtime home, one week after falling ill. He was thirty-four years old.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his death, Gray reportedly had completed a substantial portion of a major new book, though this unfinished manuscript has never turned up. Even the original manuscript and drawings for Gray\u2019s Anatomy have disappeared (most likely, I learned, they had gone up in flames when a fire decimated the British publisher\u2019s archives the year Gray died). I probably would have left it at that\u2014 my curiosity about Henry Gray more than satisfied, my dream of contributing to medical history properly deferred\u2014had I not come across one last thing: a photograph included in the one hundredth\u2013anniversary edition of his Anatomy.\r\n\r\nTaken fifteen months before his death, the photo shows Gray and two dozen young men grouped in what looks like a large art studio, with a high vaulted ceiling and drawings pinned to the walls. Sun- light pours down through the banks of skylights. Some standing, some seated, many of the young men have on long white smocks over their suits and ties\u2014one even sports a beret\u2014yet they wear uniformly solemn expressions, as if bearers of grim diagnoses. None is more serious, though, than Henry Gray. He is seated on a stool in the foreground, next to one of several low tables. A diminutive man with dark, deep-set eyes and thick, wavy hair, he looks like a pint-sized Heathcliff. Brooding and intense, he stares at the camera, waiting the long seconds for the shutter to close. This is, of course, a class photo, and no one holds the pose better than the cadaver lying just to Henry Gray\u2019s right. Poking out from under a covering, its pale, narrow feet protrude over the table\u2019s edge.\r\n\r\nI could not get this picture out of my head: the spacious chamber bathed in daylight; the dead body on the table, its upper half sliced off by the picture\u2019s edge; and, most of all, the anatomist himself. Something about the look on Gray\u2019s face seized my imagination in a way that I can only compare\u2014odd as this may sound\u2014to love at first sight: an overpowering desire to get to know this man as thoroughly as possible. My course of action then seemed perfectly clear: I would come to know Henry Gray by coming to know human anatomy.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Anatomist<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"A blend of history, science, culture, and author Bill Hayes\u2019s own personal experiences, The Anatomist uncovers the extraordinary lives of Henry Gray and H.V.

But nowadays, the gulf between the arts and the sciences has been filled by the silt of popular culture, and the mischief people fear is that of experimental biology. Many in the most avant of the literary garde have turned from math to myth, while many of the folk doing the newest of science haven\u2019t looked at a line of verse since college. I share with W. H. Auden the recollection that \u201dMy father was both a physician and a scholar so I never got the idea that art and science were opposing cultures\u2014both were entertained equally in my home.\u201d The essays in this book are addressed to those interested in keeping the entertainment going.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Mortal and Immortal DNA<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Gerald Weissmann\u2019s Mortal and Immortal DNA takes us on a scientifically informed exploration of the western canon, from Greek mythology to W.H.

His horse fell and was later found beheaded in the grass.\r\n\r\nBut Eduard gave little thought to his horses. The Auerspergs took greater pride in their hunting dogs. They were Weimaraners, direct descendants of the Chiens Gris de Saint Louis, the unicorn hunters of medieval tapestry, and they had for centuries guarded over the meadows and moraine of western Austria and lower Germany. Their colorless eyes reflected the mountain wastes like white amulets.\r\n\r\nThe prince had in fact personally overseen his dogs\u2019 breeding in order to meet the standards of the German Weimaraner Club. Doing so wasn\u2019t hard with animals of such pure stock. One had only to look out for the longhair trait, forbidden by the club\u2019s studbook. Eduard was convinced that careful breeders like himself would soon eradicate the flaw from the hounds of Bavaria and Austria.\r\n\r\nYet only that morning of the hunt, he\u2019d discovered two drowsy dun-colored pups who, not needing the warmth of their brothers and sisters, lay apart on the rug in the drafty minstrel\u2019s hall. Longhairs among his own dogs! If word got out, the club could expel him, or sterilize his dogs. And worse, the source was almost certainly Mars: Freya had littered sixteen pups with short coats before mating with Mars, and Mars had never sired before. Prince von Auersperg would prefer not to shoot the animal; he was the best hunting dog the prince had ever had. He never failed to bring back the quarry, each time laying the marmot or grouse at the prince\u2019s feet and turning right around to watch the mountain again with those eyes still and pale as an old moon. But the dog\u2019s breeding was a problem that remained unsolved, and it worried the prince all that day.\r\nThe prince tested the air with a wave of his palm. A warm and dry F\u00f6hn had blown down from the mountaintops in the last days, bringing clear weather and turning the mountains cobalt blue, but the dust now hovering on the roads portended rain. Well, he was not yet too old to hunt the Zillertal in September, whatever the weather.\r\n\r\nThe hounds ran, and patches of morning mist rolled over the cracked limestone, so that the dogs\u2019 wild barking seemed at times to come up out of the ground itself. The horses sailed the riders over the mist with loud clopping on the stone and quick thuds on the turf like a pelting of gunfire. The rifles creaked against the leather saddles. The horns echoed from the Kamm\u00eb and ravines loomed up so suddenly in the hazy morning light, one had to be very skilled on a horse to avoid a nasty fall. By the time the sun had burned away the mist, a fox was caught, but the prince\u2019s horse tumbled down the brook leading to the Zamserbach. The prince was unhurt. He ordered the horse shot through the brain, and it was done under a midday sun. The hunters headed off to the inn at Breitlahner for lunch.\r\n\r\nWhen the prince had gone, carrying his fox by the neck, the steed was beheaded, washing the grass in blood.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Jump Artist<\/title>\n<meta

The mission of Science Progress is to provide an opportunity for scientists and non-scientists to share ideas about ways that scientific and technological innovation can contribute to human flourishing.\r\n\r\nGiven its genesis in a Washington think tank, the Science Progress conversation focused first on \u201cinside the beltway\u201d policymakers\u2014a much-maligned but invaluable American species. Derided in the vernacular of Capitol Hill as \u201cwonks,\u201d these public servants and their minions are burdened with the enormous responsibility of translating the nation\u2019s collective knowledge and wisdom into practical, political, and economic action.\r\n\r\nWe at Science Progress have grown increasingly inspired, though, by the range of smart ideas outside those conventional circles and by the public hunger to become more a part of the process of bringing the art of science to good governance. With Science Next we take the conversation to a new level, and invite you to be part of it. After all, \u201cwonk\u201d spelled backwards is \u201cknow.\u201d And it is knowledge\u2014including public knowledge and understanding of science as an engine of progress\u2014that will reveal solutions to today\u2019s most pressing problems, including climate change, energy independence, and national security.\r\n\r\nThe phrase \u201cscience progress\u201d is, arguably, a bit awkward. Some would say it is redundant; others, less sanguine about where science is going, might call it contentious. But we who have been cultivating the pages of Science Progress find the construction provocative in the best sense of the word. It reminds us that we are the inheritors of the Enlightenment\u2019s confidence in the possibility of improving the human condition\u2014a possibility predicated on values of individual freedom, social equality, and democratic solidarity, and one that values reason as superior to dogma or blindly \u201creceived wisdom.\u201d From this stand- point, scientific inquiry is the paradigmatic exercise of Enlightenment values.\r\n\r\nYou got a problem with that? Well let\u2019s go at it, because one of the things we love about science is that it is nothing if not argumentative. Both as a way of thinking and as a wellspring of novel ideas and products, science is a tumultuous truth-seeking process and even further, we contend, a revolutionary force for human liberation. This under- standing of science as progressive does not deny that the power of science may be misused. Nor does it exclude the importance of other sources of inspiration or belittle the need for guidance and even regulation to ensure that the products of our progress are distributed fairly. But it does assert that the core values of science are democratic and antiauthoritarian. And it reflects a philosophical commitment to perpetual change and improvement over certainty and stasis.\r\n\r\nThe very words \u201cscience\u201d and \u201cprogress\u201d took on their modern meanings in the nineteenth century, and it should not be surprising that they came of age around the same time. It was an era in which micro- scopes and telescopes were drilling down and up into nature, while stethoscopes were revealing the body\u2019s mysterious inner space. Systematic investigation involving the careful manipulation of isolated variables was beginning to prove itself superior to mere observation, speeding the shift from mere anecdote to real evidence. The possibilities that could emerge from human insight were beginning to seem endless. Science as progressive, however, boasts philosophical and political skeins stretching much further back into the American historical experience. Francis Bacon\u2019s utopian New Atlantis is often credited as being the first literary work to express the modern idea of progress in terms of advancing science and technology. It was a vision that was to have a profound effect on later seventeenth-century thinkers, including those who provided the intellectual justification for the American Revolution. For all the founders\u2019 disagreements, they shared the conviction that the new nation\u2019s promise was necessarily bound up with its innovative genius. Even those bitter rivals Jefferson and Hamilton were of one mind as they made their synergistic contributions to America\u2019s identity as a nation dedicated to modernity: Jefferson through the patent statute and Hamilton by laying the foundations for history\u2019s most successful capitalist economy, which together have so rewarded and nourished inventiveness.\r\n\r\nIt is no coincidence that so many of the concepts at the very heart of how America has come to understand itself\u2014ideas such as the frontier and the West\u2014demand an experimental attitude in grappling with novel challenges. The optimistic \u201ccan do\u201d spirit; the approval of bigness, boldness, and adventure; the lure of \u201cthe road\u201d\u2014all are associated with this sensibility and are at the heart of our veneration of this country\u2019s great inventors, people like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, Jonas Salk, and Bill Gates. We hold these truths of perseverance and perspicacity to be, if not self-evident, at least within our grasp.\r\n\r\nEven as America\u2019s western frontier has vanished, the pioneer spirit and the virtues and values associated with it have maintained their powerful hold over the American psyche. Inspired by that vision, Americans have repeatedly heeded the call to cross new and ever more challenging frontiers\u2014including those well beyond the comforts of our cozy planet. Indeed, few government initiatives have been so wildly successful in capturing the public imagination as the space program of the 1960s, which explicitly drew upon the American frontier spirit. \u201c[W]e stand today on the edge of a New Frontier,\u201d John F. Kennedy exhorted in 1960 as he clinched the Democratic nomination for president. \u201cBeyond that frontier are the uncharted areas of science and space, unsolved problems of peace and war, unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.\u201d","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 -

In his dream he finds himself in a society where music education has been made mandatory. \u201cWe are helping our students become more competitive in an increasingly sound-filled world.\u201d Educators, school systems, and the state are put in charge of this vital project. Studies are commissioned, committees are formed, and decisions are made\u2014all without the advice or participation of a single working musician or composer.\r\n\r\nSince musicians are known to set down their ideas in the form of sheet music, these curious black dots and lines must constitute the \u201clanguage of music.\u201d It is imperative that students become fluent in this language if they are to attain any degree of musical competence; indeed, it would be ludicrous to expect a child to sing a song or play an instrument without having a thorough grounding in music notation and theory. Playing and listening to music, let alone composing an original piece, are considered very advanced topics and are generally put off until college, and more often graduate school.\r\n\r\nAs for the primary and secondary schools, their mission is to train students to use this language\u2014to jiggle symbols around according to a fixed set of rules: \u201cMusic class is where we take out our staff paper, our teacher puts some notes on the board, and we copy them or transpose them into a different key. We have to make sure to get the clefs and key signatures right, and our teacher is very picky about making sure we fill in our quarter-notes completely. One time we had a chromatic scale problem and I did it right, but the teacher gave me no credit because I had the stems pointing the wrong way.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn their wisdom, educators soon realize that even very young children can be given this kind of musical instruction. In fact it is considered quite shameful if one\u2019s third-grader hasn\u2019t completely memorized his circle of fifths. \u201cI\u2019ll have to get my son a music tutor. He simply won\u2019t apply himself to his music home-work. He says it\u2019s boring. He just sits there staring out the window, humming tunes to himself and making up silly songs.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the higher grades the pressure is really on. After all, the students must be prepared for the standardized tests and college admissions exams. Students must take courses in scales and modes, meter, harmony, and counterpoint. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot for them to learn, but later in college when they finally get to hear all this stuff, they\u2019ll really appreciate all the work they did in high school.\u201d Of course, not many students actually go on to concentrate in music, so only a few will ever get to hear the sounds that the black dots represent. Nevertheless, it is important that every member of society be able to recognize a modulation or a fugal passage, regardless of the fact that they will never hear one. \u201cTo tell you the truth, most students just aren\u2019t very good at music. They are bored in class, their skills are terrible, and their homework is barely legible. Most of them couldn\u2019t care less about how important music is in today\u2019s world; they just want to take the minimum number of music courses and be done with it. I guess there are just music people and non-music people. I had this one kid, though, man was she sensational! Her sheets were impeccable\u2014every note in the right place, perfect calligraphy, sharps, flats, just beautiful. She\u2019s going to make one hell of a musician someday.\u201d\r\n\r\nWaking up in a cold sweat, the musician realizes, gratefully, that it was all just a crazy dream. \u201cOf course,\u201d he reassures himself, \u201cno society would ever reduce such a beautiful and meaningful art form to something so mindless and trivial; no culture could be so cruel to its children as to deprive them of such a natural, satisfying means of human expression. How absurd!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2026\r\n\r\nSadly, our present system of mathematics education is precisely this kind of nightmare. In fact, if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a child\u2019s natural curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn\u2019t possibly do as good a job as is currently being done\u2014I simply wouldn\u2019t have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soul-crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that something is wrong. The politicians say, \u201cWe need higher standards.\u201d The schools say, \u201cWe need more money and equipment.\u201d Educators say one thing, and teachers say another. They are all wrong. The only people who understand what is going on are the ones most often blamed and least often heard: the students. They say, \u201cMath class is stupid and boring,\u201d and they are right.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 -

Lives They Left Behind"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Willard State Psychiatric Hospital, overlooking Seneca Lake in rural upstate New York, housed more than 54,000 people during its 126 years of operation. Some were released to their communities after decades of institutionalization, but many more died there. If not for the discovery of 400 suitcases filled with patients\u2019 belongings in the hospital attic when the facility closed in 1995, their lives would have been lost to history. This discovery led the authors\u2014a psychiatrist and an ex-patient advocate\u2014to conduct a detailed study of the lives of the suitcase owners, to curate an exhibit at the New York State Museum in Albany that attracted more than 300,000 visitors, to speak to audiences across the country about the lives of the suitcase owners, and to write this book.<\/p>\n<p>In <em>The Lives They Left Behind<\/em>, the contents of ten of these suitcases are skillfully examined and compared to the written record to create a moving and devastating group portrait of twentieth-century American psychiatric care. Richer, more complex lives than indicated by the hospital records emerge from a wide array of personal effects, including letters to loved ones, photographs of school chums and foreign travels, knickknacks, religious tracts, a christening gown, professional photographic equipment, and a delicate hand-painted bone china teacup and saucer. Here are gripping personal dramas of new immigrants and native-born Americans, men and women of different races and ethnicities, among them a young, dispossessed German nun, a Scottish nurse, a Filipino student, and an African-American World War II veteran. These people coped with a host of problems in times of war, economic hardship, and cultural dislocation. The confusion following displacement, the rage or despair resulting from illness, loss of loved ones, or sudden poverty, and the experience of hearing disembodied voices were only some of the misfortunes that put them on the path to institutionalization, from which most did not escape alive.<\/p>\n<p>As it restores the humanity of the individuals it so poignantly evokes, <em>The Lives They Left Behind<\/em> reveals the vast historical inadequacies of a psychiatric system that has yet to heal itself.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><em>The Lives They Left Behind<\/em>, written by Darby Penney and Peter Stastny with photographs by Lisa Rinzler, is based on the contents of more than four hundred abandoned suitcases filled with patients\u2019 belongings that were found when Willard State Psychiatric Hospital closed in 1995 after 126 years of operation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":4487,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","enabled":false}}},"product_cat":[362,50],"product_tag":[1252,201,1249],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"acf":{"sm_book_page_count":"208","book_subtitle":"Suitcases from a State Hospital Attic","related_author":[128,129],"sm_reading_group_copy":"","sm_reading_group_discussion":"","sm_book_excerpt":"The Sheltered Workshop Building stands alone on a hill overlooking Seneca Lake next to the empty lot that once held Chapin Hall, the massive central building of Willard State Hospital in New York. When that towering, meandering structure was torn down in 1988, the institution lost its architectural heart, leaving a scattered bunch of buildings that housed nearly a thousand mental patients until the state finally decided to abandon the entire facility in 1995. That spring, all remaining patients were distributed to other institutions. Curators and state workers roamed the grounds, trying to safeguard anything that might be worth keeping before the buildings were condemned. They scurried from building to building, determined to beat the looming deadline of the demolition crews.\r\n\r\nBeverly Courtwright and Lisa Hoffman, two local women who worked at Willard, knew the place intimately. They guided Craig Williams, a curator from the New York State Museum, to the spots that offered the most promise for finding important artifacts. Beverly remembered that there was something stashed under the roof of the Sheltered Workshop Building. She led the group up the steep staircase to the attic and then to a door in a partition under pigeon-infested rafters. Once the door was pried open, they were struck by an awesome sight: a beam of sunlight streaming down a central corridor that separated rows of wooden racks tightly filled with suitcases of all shapes and sizes\u2014men\u2019s on the left side, women\u2019s on the right, alphabetized, labeled, and covered by layers of bird droppings, apparently untouched for a great many years.\r\n\r\nCrates, trunks, hundreds of standard suitcases, doctor\u2019s bags, and many-shaped containers were all neatly arrayed under the watchful eyes of the pigeons who had come to join the lost souls and their worldly possessions. For Beverly and some others who saw it, this upper room exuded an unearthly air, a hovering presence of hundreds of souls or spirits attached to the many people who had handled and worn the items in those bags before they were packed, who had read the books, written in the diaries, and looked into the mirrors they contained.\r\n\r\nCraig Williams, realizing that he had stumbled across a dream of a treasure, called for additional trucks to salvage the luggage. \u201cJust keep ten, and throw the rest away,\u201d he was told. Fortunately, Craig ignored this order, and within hours, all 427 suitcases were wrapped in plastic and driven to the museum\u2019s warehouse. He knew this was a unique historical find, but one that could not be dealt with immediately. Interns and volunteers cataloged the items in some of the suitcases over the next three years, but the majority of them remained unopened.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, a group of archivists and curators, including Craig Williams, met with officials of the New York State Office of Mental Health to brief them on a ten-year plan to document the history of mental health in the state. Almost as an aside, Craig mentioned the patient suitcases in the museum\u2019s warehouse from the Willard attic that were saved from destruction when the facility closed in 1995.\r\n\r\nThis is where we\u2014the authors\u2014come in. One person at the meeting, Darby Penney, recognized the potential of this historic find to shed light on the lives of forgotten mental patients. She was Director of Recipient Affairs, a position created in the early 1990s to facilitate input from current and former patients about policies and programs. Darby invited her colleague Peter Stastny, a psychiatrist and documentary filmmaker, to join the project. Peter brought in photographer Lisa Rinzler to guide the team\u2019s visual approach. This collaboration resulted in a major exhibit at the New York State Museum in 2004, attended by over 600,000 visitors; a website (www.SuitcaseExhibit.org); a traveling exhibit; and, ultimately, this book.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Lives They Left
