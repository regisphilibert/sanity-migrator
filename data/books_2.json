But beneath this bright and cheery tale lie darker layers of myth, alchemy, magic, ritual, oracle, memory, for- getting, fear, and melancholy.\r\n\r\nAnemia is not exactly a disease but rather a core medical idea, like fever, that spans the world\u2019s many ages and its many places. How a culture comprehends this deficiency of blood, among the commonest of all human afflictions, bespeaks its concerns, its science, and its mythos.\r\n\r\nThe complete biography of a disease would unfold both its rationalized knowing (science) and its other-mediated knowing, which takes the form of folkloric, literary, religious, symbolic, and vatic expression. Also its poems, whether lyric, epic, ode, or dithyramb; also its unknowing.\r\nAnemia, anemic, no blood, bloodless, a deficiency of blood. My life\u2019s blood is deficient.\r\n\r\nAnemia is a doctor\u2019s number, rendered by a machine. Anemia is a man\u2019s pallor, his weakness, his fatigue, his sickness. I feel weak, I feel myself less a man, my manhood slips away, my lifeblood slips away, so this is how it is, living less, someday living not. The number half-records the sensation and half-predicts it, a foretaste of future dying, also a forecast. The physician speaks and listens, the blood count speaks, too, to him.\r\n\r\nAnemia is a new idea, born of the instruments and later the machines that measure the properties of a person\u2019s blood. Anemia is an old idea, touching all we think and feel of blood, all we have ever thought or felt, here or elsewhere, now or before. Anemia aligns pairs of opposites: strength and weakness, vigor and lassitude, ruddy and pale, hearty and sickly, lively and moribund, robust and sallow, active and passive, virile and effete, sanguine and melancholic. Blood is life, lost blood is lost life, spilt life, anemia.\r\n\r\nBlood circulates within the vessels and the heart, within the flesh and the organs, constant motion, life. Blood sits tranquilly under the microscope.\r\n\r\nThis book is an excursion, riff, or romp through the many cultural, literary, mythological, ritualistic, historical, and to some degree biological aspects of the medical condition anemia. To avoid cluttering the pages with footnotes, the references occur in endnotes that are an integral part of the text itself. These mean to add to the reader\u2019s pleasure, not to spin about academics. I invite readers who like this sort of thing to look at them from time to time.\r\n\r\nIs anemia the sickly feeling a patient experiences, or the cells seen by a microscopist, or the number a machine prints out, the doctor interpreting the number, the patient hearing his number related, the construction of anemia, its history, its story, its understory, its fictive representations, its memory, its linkages, its metaphors, its allegories, its ceremonies, its concrete indication of disease or death? Its alieniloquium, its other- speak? Would a complete account not include all these things? If you prick us, do we not bleed?","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Pale Faces<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Pale Faces explores how anemia affects our most essential bodily fluid: blood.

He hunkers down near Stan to see if he won\u2019t make eye contact. Luke is six four, and even halved he is still taller than most of his charges.\r\n\r\nStan pulls the juice tin of colored pencils down one side of the low child\u2019s table, then across its lower ledge, then pushes the tin up to the top left-hand corner. He selects a pencil from the forty-five that are there, the same green pencil\u2014vert vif\u2014every session, then moves the tin counterclockwise back to its original position.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the morning, yesterday, the earth moved, jolted. You draw that for me, Stan? You give me a sense of what that felt like for you?\u201d Luke pauses. He looks at Stan\u2019s thin, finely boned face, the huge eyes full of intelligence, perception, ferocity. Luke likes Stan\u2019s stylish eyeglasses, wonders absently what they cost, the blue frames with the snazzy ultra-thin line of red running across the top. \u201cBut I\u2019d rather you just talked to me, buddy,\u201d he says, knowing the minute Stan does speak, Luke will have to work hard and fast at the sorting out, the putting together\u2014is that a sentence from The Lion King or from The Manchurian Candidate? Luke stands up and shakes out his legs. His knees ache. He is better and better at racketball and this makes him unhappy, this being more skillful at something in the company of men alone\u2014how regressive is that!\u2014and the four tall, claustrophobic walls, his disorientation more and more often\u2014Where is the door? How do I get out of here?\u2014the balls strafing past his ears maniacally, so how he\u2019s gotten better might be a mystery, but it isn\u2019t. He\u2019s madder, more aggressive; that pas- sage to \u201cbetter,\u201d he\u2019d rather have no part of. He supposes there are women who play racketball, but his reach at six four is expansive and he\u2019d be wary of clipping her with a racket. Anyway, that\u2019s not exactly what he wants, a racketball partner.\r\n\r\nHe leans back against one of the chairs in front of his desk. He loves Stan\u2019s straight blond hair, which is left to fall to his shoulders. He already looks like a graduate student, Luke thinks, but an ethereal one. Stan positions the pencil carefully in his fingers, pulling his own thumb farther down the pencil\u2019s shaft. He then smoothes the air above the paper for several seconds with the backs of his hands. He steps away, steps forward, and begins. He draws swiftly, adroitly, his hand flying two inches above the page; he pulls a line down left, then extends it farther, tweaks a detail in the upper right corner, worries something dead center, eddying the pencil around and around\u2014it might be a Giacometti face\u2014but there is absolutely no mark on the paper anywhere.\r\n\r\nSomething occurs to Luke that has not before: Stan is tall for seven, beautifully proportioned, as elegant as a giraffe, but he will only lean over so far. The child\u2019s table is low for him, and Luke has never seen Stan of his own accord, or willingly, take to a chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cHey, buddy, let\u2019s set you up here.\u201d Luke drags a chair away from the front of his desk and clears away the picture of Sadie, the smaller picture of Man and his man, a rock formation off the coast of Cornwall, England, and a silver letter opener which should not have been out during a session anyway. He leans across his desk and slides them into a drawer. He pushes his blotter aside and then pulls from the child\u2019s table the pad Stan has been gesturing over. Luke positions it carefully on the desk. \u201cBring your pencil, guy. Draw here, okay? The desk will be a better height for you to work on.\u201d\r\n\r\nStan doesn\u2019t turn around to face Luke or to acknowledge what Luke has suggested and now arranged for him. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to sit in a chair,\u201d Luke urges. Stan stands very still, a small, narrow statue; there is a tremendous, calamitously still anger rigidifying his body, and then the anger is kinetic and he begins to turn, his arms held close to his body, turning, turning, dervishing, his arms opening to maintain his balance, and Luke knows he must wait, maybe five, maybe ten, maybe fifteen minutes before Stan stops, and that, in fact, it is therapeutic for Stan to twirl, that he\u2019ll be calmer afterward, his coordination better.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>A Proper Knowledge<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"A Proper Knowledge, by Michelle Latiolais, tells the story of a gifted psychiatrist, who is seeking to penetrate the mysteries of childhood autism.

I liked it because it was pink and pretty and old. Someone\u2019s old slip \u2014 it had mystery. It was the kind of lingerie that today\u2019s lingerie tries to imitate.\r\n\r\n\u2026\r\n\r\nFor days I was writing, unable to sleep. I woke up in bed on a sunny afternoon, unsure of the day and when I had last eaten. I started packing all of my white and grey clothes and my favorite magazines and postcards. I would need these items for my trip. I was the chosen art historian for the trip into the atmosphere. There is a hole in my memory where time passed.\r\n\r\nI remember twirling in front of my mirror, crying about something dark, and my mind repeating, \u201cHe\u2019s a great man.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy sister called and maybe I told her about my idea that Dad had invented the Internet, and that he was, in fact, God. I can\u2019t remember. But she knew something was wrong because my Mom called next. Anxiously, I told her that I knew they were all sitting at Grandma\u2019s house watching me \u2014 Dad, Mom, Christine, David, and everyone, using the hidden cameras. \u201cI wish you would just tell me,\u201d I said. \u201cPut him on the phone, and tell him I want to go to the beach now,\u201d I concluded. My mom told me to stay in my room, that she was sending Emilio, our family friend who lived north of Rome, to see me.\r\n\r\nI took a bath in the blue bathroom that all the girls on my floor shared. The room was so lovely, all tile and utilitarian, but clean and the most rich Mediterranean blue.\r\n\r\nThe lady from downstairs knocked on the door and said \u201cthey\u201d called, and were coming. She told me to stay in my room. I panicked, apparently forgetting who \u201cthey\u201d were.\r\n\r\nAfter quickly drying off, I put on my lovely pink slip over my favorite silver pants. I decided I would only take what was necessary. I grabbed my wine-colored hat with the thin black bow, my camera, and my long black coat. It was, after all, a cool December day.\r\n\r\nIn the hallway, I heard the single elevator rising to the fifth floor. I knew it was them. Like a fugitive, I ran down the stairs and bolted out of the front door when the lady at the desk turned her head. I ran down Via Panisperna, onto Milano, and up Nazionale towards the Opera. At that moment, I just knew that David was in Rome! I remembered (falsely) that we had made a plan to meet at the first hotel we stayed at when we visited Rome together a year before. I knew he was there waiting for me and wouldn\u2019t be there much longer. If I were late, he would leave forever, and I would be turned into one of those statues in front of the tourist traps that stand very still for money. And I would be standing, frozen forever, the girl with the slip, wine- colored hat, and camera.\r\n\r\nSo I ran to meet David, the hardest I\u2019ve ever run. But then I stopped, second- guessing myself, thinking that maybe that is just what they\u2019d expect me to do. Instead, what I should do is just the opposite. Yes, they would never expect that I would stand still and wait for him to come. I stood still on the sidewalk, holding my Pentax K1000 with bare hands, my unbuttoned coat flapping in the wind. No, I thought, this can\u2019t be right. He\u2019ll leave without me! I should RUN to meet him. YES! Then I ran. NO! Stand still. NO. RUN! NO! YES! I had Mercury pulsing in my veins. So I gave my hat away. I just handed it to a woman, while she spoke rapid Italian that I couldn\u2019t even hear. I pressed my hat with the petite bow to her, and I ran off, still, I think, trying to reach David.\r\n\r\nNext, perhaps in an effort to run faster, I gave my camera away. The camera that my uncle had passed down to me, my only camera, my favorite camera. I handed it to someone and ran. In mid stride, I took off my coat to give to a woman. She shook her head speaking nonsense, and put it back on my bare shoulders. I was wearing just my pink slip, without a bra. Nothing. I ran faster than before, afraid I might be too late, to the metro station. No wallet, no money, I jumped the turnstile and ran. The security guard prevailed.\r\n\r\nI was being dragged by two guards through the crowd of people waiting for the train. I heard my own screams echoing off of the walls, and I saw people staring at me the way people stare at a person who is screaming and kicking in a public place. But my head was buzzing with more and faster thoughts, so many that I\u2019ll never remember, and I couldn\u2019t stop myself.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with

Benoit had been awarded a grant by the National Science Foundation to study the microbiology of a strange group of permanently ice-covered lakes located in the rugged coastal valleys (now called the McMurdo Dry Valleys) near the Ross Sea. The lakes had been discovered by the first expedition of the great Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott (1901-4), but only a few scientists had visited them in the intervening years and little had been written about them in the scientific literature. In 1968, I was a graduate student at work on a project in physical chemistry and nearly a year away from completing my doctoral program. When I heard that Benoit and his graduate assistant, Roger Hatcher, needed a chemist, I quickly volunteered, thinking that this would be a wonderful way to learn some- thing about limnology, the science of lakes, and to explore a part of the world that I would most likely never see again.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset, I found the science, and indeed, everything about the Antarctic continent, fascinating. It was the most austere and beautiful land I had ever seen, and I was drawn to it immediately, in ways and for reasons I did not understand. When I was not analyzing the unimaginably clear waters of Lake Vanda or Lake Bonney, two of the ice-covered lakes we had come to study, I was walking and thinking and writing page after page of notes in my journal, trying to describe what I was seeing and feeling in this improbable Eden of ice and stone. My words seemed always to fall short, and seem to do so to this day.\r\n\r\nThe years passed after that first encounter, but the lakes and the valleys of Antarctica remained vivid memories, a daydream away. Gradually my professional interests turned from the pure laboratory chemistry in which I had been trained to the science of geochemistry. From the courses that I was teaching and from the Midwestern lakes that I was studying, new questions began to arise. I began to think that the answers might lie in the distant waters of the Dry Valleys that I had once visited with Hatcher and Benoit.\r\n\r\nIn 1980 the National Science Foundation funded my proposal to study the behavior of nutrients (compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus that control the biological productivity of a lake) and heavy metals (elements such as manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, and lead) in Lake Vanda and its inflow, the Onyx River. This turned out to be the beginning of a ten-year investigation that gradually encompassed more lakes and more subtle and vexing questions. How and when had these odd water bodies evolved? Why were they so different in their chemical compositions? How were they sustained biologically in such a harsh environment? How were the chemical elements transported to them, and how were those elements removed? Because they were so biologically uncomplex, might these lakes not serve as beautifully simple models for other bodies of water on the Earth? Perhaps even the oceans? Because they seemed to cleanse themselves of the metals brought into their waters, might they not tell us something about the way the Earth regenerates itself? These were some of the questions that brought me back to Antarctica five more times during the 1980s and, most recently, from October to December of 1994.\r\n\r\nThus the present book draws on more than fourteen months of journal notes collected over seven field seasons. It arose, I think, from the need to talk about the Antarctic work in a more reflective and personal way\u2014in a way that could not easily be accommodated within the pages of professional journals. From the outset, the continent raised questions for me that went beyond the purview of science. These were questions about the ways we experience the world and respond to its physical settings; how we decide, as individuals, to do with our lives what we do with them; the sources of our wonder; the nature of science itself.

Decades ago when the medical model was paternalistic, we were accustomed to hearing only of the relationship between doctor and patient; it stood as though alone, supreme among lesser associations that the sick form with those around them. Perhaps the doctor-patient relationship is still the keystone, or perhaps it is no more critical to recovery than those other interpersonal bonds. Either way, that ancient traditional linkage can today be best seen as part of a context of relationships that is far bigger than has, until recently, been acknowledged. The structure of that bigger context centers around the patient, his or her disease, and the perceptions of it that combine to form the experience unique to each individual. The patient has a story to tell, and so does every other participant in the calculus of healing.\r\n\r\nThis volume is an anthology of such stories. Whatever else may be its lessons, it teaches us the ways in which we are bound up together in the presence of illness. Every member of the healing surround sees people, problems, and events in ways different from every other member, and tells of them in a different voice. In this book, the rhythms and cadences of the sick and needful merge with the rhythms and cadences of those who would heal them, either with the technology of which they are masters, or the love they bring, or\u2014far more often than might be thought\u2014both.\r\n\r\nI say both because, ultimately, the best of healing is expressed in ways that can be recognized as encompassed by the Greek word agape, as used by Paul in chapter 13 of I Corinthians. Translated into Latin as caritas and into English most accurately as \u201ccaring love,\u201d agape is recognized by Paul as being even greater than faith or hope. Healing involves all three, \u201cbut the greatest of these is caring love.\u201d There are stories of caritas in these pages, but there are also stories of frustration and anger and disappointment. This is because attempts to heal are so much more complex than can be appreciated except by those immersed in them. And too often, even the participants cannot recognize the emotions that whirl their turbulent way through the minds of anyone but themselves. This is not for want of wanting\u2014we certainly all endeavor to find empathy\u2014but for want of being able to see inside minds not our own. The stories in this book guide us toward the paths to understanding.\r\n\r\nWe write for any, and often several, of a multitude of reasons. Those who heal and those who would be healed\u2014patients, family members, doctors, nurses, medical students, technologists, social workers, everyone\u2014need some way to express what they are feeling. To write about feelings is to bring them forth from some inner place into a form in which they can be seen with perhaps less of the passion of the moment, and with more equanimity. Triumph and tragedy need distance, if their meaning is to become incorporated into the wisdom we hope to gain from the events of our lives. Writing about one\u2019s own or another\u2019s experience of illness is very much like the literary form it often takes, namely poetry, described by Wordsworth as being, \u201cemotion recollected in tranquility.\u201d Yet, some of the finest of both prose and poetry have been created when the writer is not yet tranquil, and still feeling the untamed and amorphous torrent of what is being described. Once on the page, though, it becomes more a thing of substance and shape, more accessible, more governable\u2014and therefore more a thing from which truths can be learned, both by ourselves and our readers.\r\n\r\nTo write is also to share, so that one is no longer alone with emotions whose meaning can become clarified by the telling. The process of finding words to express the feeling, and then transcribing those words onto a page is something like seeking advice from a wise friend; elucidating a chaotic thought to readers will often elucidate it to ourselves.\r\n\r\nWriting gives power to the powerless, and who feels less power than patients and family members do, or medical personnel when their efforts fail, or when they are rejected or undervalued by those meant to be helped? We need to write in order to bring back a semblance of control, to lessen feelings of impotence, and to return to compassion when it has been dispersed by the frustration of defeat or loss of self-esteem. We need to reflect on our deepest values, especially when they are threatened. At such times, the Muse allows us to muse.\r\nIn all these ways, writing is a means of healing. Whether we need healing for the wounds caused by the slings and arrows of the illnesses that are our daily portion, or whether what needs rectifying is the pomposity and self-importance into which we so easily slip, the making of literature is a balm. The medical profession has no monopoly on self-centeredness\u2014it is seen in patients and individual family members as well. It is an enemy of caritas, and therefore of healing.\r\n\r\nThe stories, essays, and poems in the following pages deal with all of this, in a spectrum of styles and voices that reveal the variety of experiences of illness and of the reactions to it. We present it as a gift, to the reader and to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\u2014SHERWIN B.

Most of form 2A lined the upper balcony, sitting on the sun-warmed concrete with bags of potato crisps, vigilant of prefects, their pleated uniforms bunched at their thighs for prime tanning. They shaded their eyes as Penny pointed. Then everyone saw the mosquito on the white railing, its pointed bill aligned with its body. There was a pause before they charged the form room. They blinked in the sudden, cool dark, breathless, uttering various bits of Afrikaans slang.\r\n\r\nThe anopheles was rampant this year, Miss Dunn said in biology. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve all been taking your quinine, girls.\u201d Colleen\u2019s face felt hot with guilt. She wondered if protozoa spun up and down her body in the flow of blood, drinking iron, bursting their way through valves. They would divide into numbers too long for a calculator. She played with her pencil, making it wobbly and buoyant. She had seen Ministry of Health movies about teen pregnancy. A girl, an actress, rubbed her temples and shook her head with secret knowledge. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d the girl finally said to her mother.\r\n\r\n\u201cI forgot to take my quinine,\u201d Colleen told the boarding mistress, and gave her the aluminum packet. It was moist and crinkled from the sweat of her palm. The woman held it before Colleen\u2019s face, its intact green pills in horizontal rows, something to read from left to right and understand completely.\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\nLong after Colleen grew up, her father still talked about the malaria. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even there,\u201d he would say. \u201cMostly you were gone, you didn\u2019t even see me. I thought you were dead.\u201d He would repeat himself, marveling, she supposes, that she didn\u2019t die like her mother, one morning years ago, of an unknown fever. Colleen had thought she was asleep, curled up on her side with the tea tray steaming next to the bed. The parquet floor was cold through the rubber feet of her pajamas. Her mother had not been dead long, they said, because when Colleen had climbed in next to her, she was only limp, only sleeping, her hands cool, not hot like the night before, and Colleen rested her head against her mother\u2019s warm chest. After a while, she noticed how her head did not rise up and down the way it usually did\u2014a kind of ride, since at seven she could no longer be rocked\u2014and she wondered if her mother was teasing her, holding her breath, and Colleen held her breath too, and no one moved, nothing, not even their eyes.\r\n\r\nMalaria must have seemed more definite to her father, an infection with a household name, perhaps a thing he could stop with his knowledge of its seriousness. He flew up to Salisbury in a single-engine Cessna. He stayed on the sixth floor of the Monomatapa Hotel, as if he were on holiday. Colleen remembers chills, and the infusion of chloroquine, lukewarm with the burn of ice. The hospital had been the dark gray of a back stage, an outer world. Her hand seemed used to flapping in the air. It had tried to catch mammals with peacock-feathered wings, reached to touch soft, wrinkled faces with sad eyes. Sometimes the faces would leer. \u201cGo away,\u201d she would say, or \u201cFuck you,\u201d and her father\u2019s chair would scrape across the floor in a surprised way.\r\n\r\n\u201cOpen your eyes, Colleen.\u201d Her father had tilted her distracted chin toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re in hospital.\u201d He spoke to her as if she had lost her hearing. His mouth stretched his face. His skin was dry and transparent from the sun and reminded her of Mapipi\u2019s phyllo pastry. \u201cDo you know where you are? Rhodesia.\u201d The loud sounds pierced her head. \u201cColleen, what day is it today? Monday.\u201d She dreamed of surprise quizzes at school. She felt unprepared.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Leper Compound<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The Leper Compound is a searing evocation of late-twentieth-century African life by debut novelist Paula Nangle.

And so, it will probably come as no surprise that when he chose to identify three great intellectual earthquakes, each of them body-blows to humanity\u2019s narcissism, his own contribution figured prominently: First, Freud listed replacement of the Ptolemaic, Earth-centered universe by its Copernican rival; second, Darwin\u2019s insights into the natural, bio- logical origin of all living things, <i>Homo sapiens<\/i> included; and third, Freud\u2019s suggestion that much\u2014indeed, most\u2014of our mental activity goes on \u201cunderground,\u201d in the unconscious. (It is interesting to consider that even as he recounted a history of diminished human importance, Freud wasn\u2019t shy about his own!)\r\n\r\nIn any event, many of <i>Homo sapiens\u2019s<\/i> most glorious scientific achievements, rather than expanding our self-image, have paradoxically diminished it. But despite this progression of self-administered \u201cnarcissistic injuries\u201d (as Professor Freud would have it), a widespread feeling of centrality is nonetheless widespread, an insistence that the world somehow revolves around human beings, as a species and for most individuals. Many of us remain narcissists in this particular sense. Whereas infantile narcissism is plausible, predictable, and eventually outgrown, centrality remains fundamental\u2014dare I say \u201ccentral\u201d?\u2014to the way many adults think of themselves. But this doesn\u2019t make it true.\r\n\r\nAlmost by definition, we each experience our own private subjectivity, a personal relationship with the universe, in return for which it is widely assumed that the universe reciprocates, even though there is no evidence supporting this latter assumption . . . as well as consider- able logic urging that it is untrue. Moreover, even as the illusion of centrality may be useful, if not necessary, to normal day-to-day functioning (in a sense, analogous to the denial of one\u2019s eventual death), seductive centrality is also responsible for a lot of foolishness and even mischief.\r\n\r\nI have a friend who is paraplegic because of a rare viral infection in his spine. He was afflicted as a young adult, and although he has since managed to achieve a laudable life (loving marriage, devoted children, successful career), my friend remains obsessed with his illness, specifically <i>why<\/i> it happened to him. For decades, he has satisfied himself with this answer: He became ill \u201cin order\u201d to reconcile his parents to his then-fianc\u00e9e, now wife. My friend\u2019s parents had disliked his bride-to-be, but she stood by him throughout his terrible illness and subsequent disability; her steadfastness gradually wore down their disapproval. I hasten to add that my friend is highly intelligent and well educated. But he remains convinced that the viruses lodged in his spine were somehow recruited as part of a cosmic conspiracy designed to assure his personal matrimonial bliss. Thus he has made sense of his life.\r\n\r\nNext, consider the strange case of Tycho Brahe, which, on inspection, turns out to be not so strange after all. An influential Danish star- charter of the late 16th century, Tycho Brahe served as mentor to the great German astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler. In his own right, Brahe achieved remarkable accuracy in measuring the positions of planets as well as stars. But Brahe\u2019s greatest contribution (at least for my purpose) was one that he would doubtless prefer to leave forgotten, because Brahe\u2019s Blunder is one of those errors whose very wrongness can teach us quite a lot about ourselves and seduction of species-wide centrality.\r\n\r\nDeep in his heart, Brahe rejected the newly proclaimed Copernican model of the universe, the heretical system that threatened to wrench the Earth from its privileged position at the center of all creation and relegate it to just one of many planets that circle the sun. But Brahe was also a careful scientist whose observations were undeniable, even as they made him uncomfortable: The five known planets of Brahe\u2019s day (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) circled the sun. This much was settled. Copernicus, alas, was right, and nothing could be done about it. But Tycho Brahe, troubled of spirit yet inventive of mind, came up with a solution, a kind of strategic intellectual retreat and regrouping. It was ingenious, allowing him to accept what was irrefutably true, while still clinging stubbornly to what he cherished even more: what he wanted to be true. And so\u2014 like my friend, who, having no choice but to accept the fact of his illness, has also retained the illusion that it somehow arose in the service of his needs\u2014Brahe proposed that whereas the five planets indeed circled the sun, that same sun and its planetary retinue obediently revolved around an immobile and central Earth!\r\n\r\nMy point is that Brahean solutions are not limited to astronomy or to my wheelchair-bound friend. They reveal a widespread human tendency: Whenever possible, and however illogical, we retain a sense that we are so important that the cosmos must have been structured with us in mind.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, a brief newspaper article described a most improbable tragedy: A woman, driving on an interstate highway, had been instantly killed when a jar of grape jelly came crashing through her windshield. It seems that this jar, along with other supplies, had accidentally been left on the wing of a private airplane, which then took off and reached a substantial altitude before the jar slid off. The woman\u2019s family may well have wondered about the \u201cmeaning\u201d of her death, just as my friend ponders the meaning of his illness, and so many people wonder about the meaning of their lives. There must be a reason, they are convinced, for their existence and for their most intense experiences. Just as Tycho Brahe struggled to avoid astronomical reality, they simply cannot accept this biological truth: They were \u201ccreated\u201d by the random union of their father\u2019s sperm and their mother\u2019s egg, tossed into this world quite by accident, just as someday they will","sm_reading_group_discussion":"","sm_book_excerpt":"","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is

I read to be aided in my lust\u2014to be seduced to feel, to be lured out. I read not to be alone. I want for my day to be split open by a tidal wave of strange imaginings when I read, for something, anything, to break through. A book gains a place on my shelf for the way it forces me to remember. A sentence becomes locked in my heart for the way it helps me to forget. I admit to enjoying that \u201cgood feeling\u201d of being in the midst of something higher and better when I read, but lately I long for a literature that can throw a wrench into the works. A mucking up of the machinery is called for, and instantly I wonder how it came to be a wrench that won that telling phrase rather than a screwdriver or a hammer, because a wrench seems so right now, so necessary to messing things up and forcing the plant to shut down. Had someone been tightening by way of repairing a delicate part when, distracted, they \u201clost their grip\u201d and dropped the tool into a spring of well-greased gears, or did overzealousness for work bring the whole works to a standstill? Some anger slipped through, slipping into the work; the worker tightened too well and too hard until the wrench flew. Perhaps no accident at all incited the phrase but a worker\u2019s quite conscious rebellion. Some momentous act must have lent the world a new sense of the \u201cwrench,\u201d but now it is yours and mine to use, and use well and more often until wrench has nothing to do with a tool for tightening bolts and everything to do with injury (an ankle, say), and suddenness (a tightening in the stomach), anguish even (you grip your gut), and distorted meanings (desperately you wrest matter from nothingness). The further the wrench travels from the feeling of cold metal in my hand, the closer it comes to becoming a word: see it now standing at the far end of all that happens to us daily for which we have no words. The worker has vanished.\r\n\r\nYou write the book you want to read.\r\n\r\nSomething has to give.\r\n\r\nI try to forget my computer. I compose a novel using crayons and no sharpener. I experience a waxen feel and acknowledge unplumbed resources. If I write with my arm in a monkey grip, if I compose awkwardly\u2014forget grace\u2014the truth will out. I will not allow myself certain phrases: no sentences can begin with the word \u201ctoday,\u201d or \u201cnow,\u201d as if to plead originality, distinctness, departure, or difference. There are to be no arms raised in greeting, no morning dew, no illuminations clear as rock candy and just as liquid, dissolvable; no melting, no account of how \u201cI began to understand.\u201d No lilting, or claims of possibility, no coulds, how I could do this or that, no refrains but interruptions, and certainly no more than one reference to how I continue to avoid my reflection in the mirror, how \u201cit begins in the body,\u201d or my memory of swing sets. I\u2019ve been chattering without knowing all the while that my interlocutor is deaf. Or that my interlocutor is my deaf self. I\u2019ve been listening without hearing a thing my companion has said. Are these the conditions for awkward situations or just the norm? Poet: plaintive illuminator, exposer of secrets, paragon of self-pity who sometimes said what it was and sometimes said what it was like. Now. Today. Through the window gazing at the swing set.\r\n\r\nBut what if writing sought to describe all that has a claim on me that isn\u2019t pretty? Give me a literature of the spasm. Let sentences plunge, a pear plashing through branches gleaming gold, a gift from the gods. No. Let them ooze like a mangled, rotten, half-bitten possibly poisonous hapless thing landing with a splat onto a well- intended platter. Make a paragraph out of overstuffed drawers, the stuff of attempted purges, all you\u2019ve pushed out of sight without discarding, the drawer overflowing, the drawer that refused to be neatened, that is refuse, what is refused but can\u2019t be gotten rid of. Fashion a voice that can break the spell. Where I thought the ground was smooth, I now feel its graininess poking up into my heels, scraping my arches, piercing toes, the sound of a person pushing a locomotive up the street, beneath my window, the trundling of an overloaded trash can on wheels.\r\n\r\nI will seek out awkwardness over and against revelation, even if I find myself beginning again, against my better judgment, with a dream.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Awkward<\/title>\n<meta

Even as he studied medicine he was an artist. Even as he learned to treat patients he grew in his mastery of drawing and illustration. He had a great talent in the first field, and no less a talent in the second.\r\nAnd, since then, he has lived in both worlds. He has continued to practice dermatology as well as develop his gifts as an artist. For three decades, readers of the New York Times and other publications, as well as those who have seen his art in numerous books and exhibitions, have been illuminated by his interpretation of messages\u2014political, historical, mythical, religious.\r\n\r\nOf the many realms he has touched with his artistic work, two stand out as drawing him back to them time and again.\r\n\r\nOne is the realm of Jewish tradition, which infused him with its images and which he has infused in turn with his. The other is the realm of medicine, which also infused him with its images, and which has also been infused with his. By chance, Podwal\u2019s work in art, and mine in writing, intersected twice in the New York Times. In 1994 I discovered that an essay of mine on the dangers of physician-assisted suicide, titled \u201cFirst Do No Harm,\u201d was illustrated by a stark drawing of a skeletal hand whose fingers had been transformed into surgical instruments: the hand that could heal but also harm. It conveyed my argument better than my words did. And in 2002 an essay of mine in the Times, titled \u201cAppropriating the Holocaust,\u201d was illustrated by a striking Podwal image of multiple train tracks, in the shape of a swastika, leading to the anus mundi that was Auschwitz.\r\n\r\nBut most of Podwal\u2019s work hasn\u2019t focused on death and destruction. In the realm of medical themes, in fact, it has been, in the main, very different\u2014imaginative, clarifying, iconoclastic, incisive, whimsical, absurd, funny. It took a doctor to be able to turn doctors, including himself, into caricatured specialists, each identified by an instrument\u2014 surgical, say, or dermatological, or gynecological\u2014typically used by that specialty. It took a doctor to be able to summarize cancer as a cell that had turned into a crab\u2014 the astrological cancer. It took a doctor to be able to understand the complexity of an intensive care unit, but also to understand its inescapably embedded costs.\r\nFor Podwal, growths, with which he deals every day as a physician, could also be seen as blooming flowers. For him, the idea of radical surgery could be, whimsically, applied to hair transplants, which are, in the version radicalized by his imagination, inserted not into the scalp but into the brain below. A second opinion in the age of rationed care is not a second stethoscope listening to the patient but a second stethoscope listening to the first. The complexity and specificity of medical treatments are captured in a drawing purporting to teach which pills or injections treat which ills at which site in the body. The consequences of war are evoked by a bone dangling from a military ribbon. The projection of government, through Medicare, into the lives of all Americans is shown by a Capitol dome sprouting tentacles that hold medical instruments. Medical conditions, seen under a microscope, reify their metaphorical medical names: ichthyosis (fish skin), drawn at high power resolution, reveals\u2014little fish! And dermatophytosis (a fungal infection), as seen through\r\n\r\nPodwal\u2019s microscope, reveals\u2014what else?\u2014mushrooms. Only a doctor\u2014and a dermatologist at that\u2014would have the authority needed to achieve such concretized whimsy.\r\n\r\nOnly a doctor, moreover, living in the age of managed care, which in some ways has ensnared not only patients but also physicians, could have the insight, provoked by bureaucratically-induced pain, to draw an image of a \u201cprovider\u201d\u2014as insurance companies and Medicare have come to call doctors\u2014as a voodoo doll: white-coated, impaled by syringes, in managed-care agony. In fact, the idea of managed care as a medical process that doesn\u2019t work\u2014because it maims the doctor, the patient or medical care itself\u2014is evoked more than once, as in the drawing of a Rube Goldberg-like medical system that managed care has managed to bury in the morass of its own complexity.\r\n\r\nMark Podwal has a lot to say about medicine. And he says it with authority, sincerity, gravity and humor\u2014and from the outside no less than from the inside.\r\n\r\n\u2014WALTER REICH, M.D.\r\nYitzhak Rabin Memorial Professor of International

By then he knew he was part of the Talented Tenth and that his was a Rising Race. It was time to get out of his protected environment, and he looked forward to being with his mother again.\r\n\r\nTo his dismay, they did not return to Hoboken, as his mother had always said they would. They went to Ridgewood, where they were servants, but in almost a castle, and there was Walter\u2014he was no Reverend Miles. Julian liked the Hatherford children, he liked the house he shared with his mother and his new school. One hot day a year after he\u2019d come to Ridgewood he went out with Mrs. Hatherford to help with shopping. They left his own mother taking care of Scott, who was recovering from an operation. Finished\u2014they bought supplies and presents for Scott\u2014they got back in the car, but rather than going directly to Ridgewood they stopped at Bergen Pines, in Oradel.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to visit the children,\u201d she said. \u201cI have so much to be grateful for. Scott went to Bergen Pines when he first got sick.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey went down a bleached empty hallway, and then up a ramp that led to a narrow dead end and a large window.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the men and boys\u2019 polio ward,\u201d Mrs. Hatherford said. \u201cScott had a private room on the other side. You stay here. It isn\u2019t safe,\u201d and she started down some short stairs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he called. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said. She was gone, he felt weak and shaky, afraid of the flickers behind the glass, the whiteness, the sea of beds, and a sound like bellows, and crying. Was he supposed to be here? Why did she leave? Why had she taken him here?\r\n\r\nThe people down there were white\u2014he realized that he was raised up, observing them from the upper half of the room so he felt less exposed. White men and teenagers, babies and kids, women in white gowns and masks feeding heads poking out from what looked like submarines\u2014iron lungs. He\u2019d seen a picture of one. There was a row of them down there, and they looked especially like submarines because each of them had a little American flag stuck on top like the ones people waved on the Fourth of July. It was the sixth of July, somebody must have brought flags for the kids. Which one was crying? He couldn\u2019t tell. Everybody looked hot, with sheets kicked back and the babies only in diapers and slings and casts and splints and things strapped to their chests, and there were two beds that rocked back and forth, and stretchers up against walls. More women came in wearing gowns and masks, one Mrs. Hatherford, he identified her by her slow swaying walk. God! One kid hung from the ceiling, like a piece of meat in a net.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw him, a little skinny guy of about three who writhed in his bed, his small mouth an O, his head in a sling, his chest strapped down by a strip of cloth tied to the sides of the bed, and on both of his arms and legs splint-braces of canvas and straps and silver buckles. He writhed, Julian had never seen a more suffering thing. O, O, Julian watched him, could not take his eyes from him.\r\n\r\n\u201cJulian.\u201d He didn\u2019t know how long had passed.\r\n\r\nThe boy was a hot thing burned into Julian\u2019s mind, and the O of the sufferer\u2019s mouth cried silently outside the car, like Julian\u2019s window in the car was the viewing glass and the boy was out there, expanded, spread, burned over everything.\r\n\r\nIt was Julian\u2019s turn to tend Scott. The curtains were closed and Scott was asleep. He loosened the sheets around Scott to let in some air. He moistened a cloth and dampened Scott\u2019s forehead, put his hands in the basin of water and softly ran his wet fingers through Scott\u2019s hair. Scott stirred, but didn\u2019t wake up. Julian sat in the chair. He had missed Scott while Scott was away for the operation, but he had also had more time for himself, to read and to dream his own dreams that had nothing to do with Scott and the Hatherfords. But something was different today in the room, and better. It was different and also the same as what he had felt for Reverend Miles.","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 -

The prospects for each day in science have never been more splendid while our larger culture seems caught in a slough of unreason. In the last half century scientists have landed us on the moon, sampled Mars, and deciphered the human genome. Our new technology permits us to clone genes on chips and dial China from the Palm in our hand. The biological revolution has cracked new diseases as they arose (Lyme, HIV, SARS) and blunted the hurt of the old (cancer, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and gout). We\u2019ve doubled the longevity of fruit flies and roundworms in the lab and increased human life span in the developed world by a decade and a half.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, much of society at large is busy revisiting the days of the Inquisition v Galileo. The wars of religion are back, superstition threatens our schools, and Bible-thumpers preach that Darwin got it wrong. Our modern heritage of reason, formed in the Enlightenment, is becoming eclipsed by what a cynic might call the Endarkenment. It\u2019s no trivial matter when the editor of Science, Donald Kennedy, asks us whether it\u2019s \u201cTwilight for the Enlightenment?\u201d1 Last year, for example, Gallup reported that 45 percent of Americans believe that God created human beings like us about 10,000 years ago. Indeed, less than a third of Americans believe that Darwin\u2019s theory is supported by scientific evidence, and just as many believe that evolution is just one of several, equally valid theories. A third of Americans believe that the Judeo-Christian Bible is the word of God to be taken literally, word for word.2 One out of five Americans believe that the sun revolves about the earth!\r\n\r\nFor over a century in the lands of the West, the forces of faith and fact have largely observed an uneasy truce. Natural scientists were expected to steer clear of moral or religious matters, the clergy (save in the American South) were not expected to contradict the findings of Galileo or Darwin. But in our dangerous decade, the battle lines have formed again and this time they\u2019ve been drawn around the globe. The trend\u2014from Mississippi to Kabul to Jakarta and Jerusalem\u2014is a return to revealed orthodoxy. Galileo may have been pardoned by his church, common descent accepted by a saintly pope, but the ancient tide of animist belief is rising again. We could have seen it coming. Fresh from the heady insights of the biological revolution, Jacques Monod warned us in his magisterial Chance and Necessity (1971) that\r\n\r\n\"Modern societies accepted the treasures and the power offered them by science. But they have not accepted\u2014they have scarcely even heard\u2014its profounder message: . . . a complete break with the animist tradition, the definitive abandonment of the \u201cold covenant,\u201d the necessity of forging a new one. Armed with all the powers, enjoying all the riches they owe to science, our societies are still trying to live by and to teach systems of values already blasted at the root by science itself.\"\r\n\r\nNowadays, in thrall to constituencies of unreason, zealots of all stripes are chipping away at evolutionary science. In our own country, \u201ccreationism\u201d and \u201cintelligent design\u201d are now considered suitable topics for instruction in science, as if these notions were as testable as the perfect gas laws of Boyle (pV = nRT) or the Hardy-Weinberg equation (p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1) of population genetics. In the new spirit of Endarkenment, we ought not to be surprised that the Bishop of Vienna warned us against Jacques Monod:\r\n\r\n\"Scientific theories that try to explain away the appearance of design as the result of 'chance and necessity' are not scientific at all, but, as John Paul put it, an abdication of human intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nSince the \u201cabdication of human intelligence\u201d might be defined as stupidity, it\u2019s clear to me that the truce has been shattered. Sad to say, it\u2019s possible that modern science may be at the stage of the arts in Quattrocento Florence, when poets and painters broke the mold of monkish severity in outbursts of wanton beauty. Savonarola responded by first scorning their intelligence and then burning their work. Schonhorn and the censors are gathering in the piazza.\r\nSo, for prelates and presidents, let\u2019s spell out the facts of evolution ever since Darwin: the facts of common descent and natural selection. Most scientists agree that evolution is no more a \u201ctheory\u201d (in the popular sense) than is gravity. Evolution is based on a collection of facts that\u2014like gravity\u2014challenge Biblical notions of the nature of the universe and our very selves. The National Academy report on \u201cEvolution and Creationism\u201d reminds us that \u201cIn science, theories do not turn into facts through the accumulation of evidence. Rather, theories are the end points of science.\u201d","sm_jacket_quotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Galileo\u2019s Gout<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"With Galileo\u2019s Gout Gerald Weissmann transports us back across more than four hundred years of pivotal moments in science and medicine.
